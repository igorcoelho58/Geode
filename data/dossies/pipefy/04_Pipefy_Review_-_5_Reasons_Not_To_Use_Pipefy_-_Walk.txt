 Hey there guys, many markers and in this video I'm going to review pipe 5 I'm going to talk to you about the pricing plans then I'm going to give you The walkthrough what you can actually find on pipe 5 and how you can use it and while I'll be doing that I'm going to talk to you about the advantages and disadvantages I personally see in pipe 5 in my opinion Pi 5 is amazing tool that you can use for your business and it's going to really optimize and Like it's going to make your business more effective and more lean I believe in that But there are some advantages and disadvantages that I see them going to talk to you about of course I'm going to like give you the alternatives to 2 pipe 5 if you're interested now without further ado Let's start and then jump to the pricing plans So we know in the moment when you come here to pipe by the first thing that what I like is that you can simply use It for free. So you see them monthly and annually Version and you see that the starter free north credit card required with this you can get really know the pipe 5 if you like it or if you enjoyed Now when I show the comparison table. Let's see so In a starter, which is for free up to five Workflows user stand unlimited cards Now really important Right here you're gonna have the business which is $20 dollars a month and 36 It's a pity that you need to request a demo for it But that's kind of like how it is a great thing that you have the annual monthly version and of course when we go further I want to show you something so add-ons power workflows you're gonna have in the enterprise And then when we go further, okay, you can have the integrations here and privacy and security Now of course you're gonna have a training and support for all of these and Even the starter is going to be like really great start for you to understand 5 5 so I like I give the thumbs up that they have the free account. That's a really good thing Then the business and enterprise Preuser per month now you need to you need to sell you buy yourself that if it's going to have value for you So that's pretty much it now guys. I have a question for you that if you could like Propose that you would try pipe 5 by yourself You'll link down below in the description and let me know if you actually like the tool What do you like what you don't like about it because in my opinion can be really effective But there comes the first disadvantage that I have here is that the learning curve is pretty high on Using pipe 5 so when you come here to pipe 5 You can get little lost of the differences between pipes and databases. Let's say I have a sales pipeline here and I have the option to switch between Kenban and list view and And many times it can get really overwhelming to understand how it works Then you're gonna find reports here the form but you don't know to watch the form is actually connect to how it works and It's going to take little bit of time to understand it. I don't that Like I like the design how it's made, but it's going to take a little bit time to actually get it right Then also the mobile applications not that great. I believe they would need to like improve it But the pipe 5 theme is working well on tool So that's pretty good And another thing that I wanted to show you is that sometimes it's a lagging right so sometimes the pipe 5 is going to be A lagging and you need to reload the page So that's another thing like deals here And like you have the database here on the top right on the top and Then here you have a deals that you can edit So Of course you're gonna have the automations here and that's something you can have and You can easily create the automation So when I'll let's say if you all this updated the card is updated Let's say a deal You can what is going to happen send an email card or you can update the field or you can create a connect card record And you just choose it right So in the automations are fun and but it there is a learning curve on how we can understand it and work with it So that's something to think about now These are the disadvantages that I found the learning curve at the mobile and sometimes it's lagging I don't that I definitely recommend pipe wide to give it a try Now what are some competitors that you can use? You can have a kiss flow that's one So So that's something you can do And also you have like Monday dot com or clickable others But in some ways the pipe five will dominate Monday dot com because it's not straight away the project management tool at least I think so with automations It can be much better now on top right. I can click on the settings here and I can have the form here the phases The members email automations So when you're gonna click on the flow here you're gonna see always like the whole process here, right? So what is going to happen? You have automation and if you would automation you would see right here and When you have the input source, let's say this is a form And When someone is going to fill it out then you're gonna find all this data here So that's pretty good so I created a tutorial on like introduction tutorial how you can use pipe five But I could create like a whole complete tutorial on this if you want me to guys And it can be fun too on all these the difference between the pies and database How you can use those now another thing would I like about by five that you're gonna have the option to To have use templates, so that's really cool. So when you come here to py-fi and I'm going to home button I can simply click here on templates next to my work and you can choose the sales lead qualification lead generation form Sales here and work full task management And you can simply switch between Multiple templates galleries and you can find the which the one that suits you the best That's a product design and I can use the template and Then you can edit the template so that's something you can do now if you can have any questions guys Regardless by five what you can do here let me down in comments. I'll really help you to help you and provide some guidance You can easily switch between the Kenban view and list view You Any this is pretty much it and this was a review for py-fi. Thank you very much guys for watching have a great day and goodbye. See ya You
