About Pipefy
A global process management and AI platform
Pipefy is a global Artificial Intelligence platform that orchestrates autonomous AI Agents, transforming the way companies manage processes, optimize workflows, and democratize access to advanced technology.
Our history
Founded in 2015 by Alessio Alionço, Pipefy was born out of user frustration with the process management and automation tools available on the market—many of which were expensive, rigid, and failed to provide autonomy to different business areas. In the past, automating a workflow meant months of projects and high costs. With Pipefy, decision-making power shifted to the end user, eliminating the need for a dedicated technical team and moving technology out of the technical bubble and into the heart of operations.
The platform grew quickly and today is driving the same democratization of technology with Artificial Intelligence. AI used to be a distant concept in business operations, limited to technical teams with large budgets. Pipefy’s mission became to make all of this instantly, simply, and realistically applicable within businesses. Pipefy now serves companies in over 100 countries, including global names like IBM, Volvo, and Itaú.
