- If you're a growing business
looking for a CRM that is easy to adopt,
aligns with your teams,
and is able to adapt with you over time,
you've totally come to the right place.
I'm Mark, and today
we're gonna show you how
HubSpot CRM is built to grow with you.
HubSpot CRM seamlessly
integrates all of your data,
your teams, and your customers
in one easy to use platform.
To get started, you're gonna
need a HubSpot account.
It's totally free for life.
Head on over to hubspot.com
and sign up for your free account.
Now let's take a look at how easy it is
to set up your company and contact records
in the CRM so that your sales, marketing,
service, and operations teams can all look
at the same customer data in one place.
Check it out.
So to get started, you're
gonna click on Contacts.
Contacts are the center of
everything in your HubSpot CRM.
Everything is built off of the contacts.
Simply click Contacts,
and here you'll be brought
to a page where you can
look at all of the contacts.
Now these are easy to filter, right now,
I can filter them by contact owner,
and I click that and it'll show you
these are all the contacts
I currently own in the CRM.
I can also filter by these
predetermined fields,
like what date was that contact created,
when was the last activity
date for this contact,
what is their lead status,
or there's a lot of advanced filters
that you can select from
and customize your CRM.
Now if I wanna look at
any of the customer data
from one of my contacts,
I can simply either click
on Preview and in the
right hand toolbar here,
you'll see that I've got some data,
the customer name, their company,
their email, and any
other information I've got
on properties for this contact.
Now if I want a little bit more detailed,
I can simply click on the customer's name
and it'll open up a whole new window
with all of the customer data.
Here you're gonna see that
right from the left toolbar,
I can take a note, I can
send this contact an email.
I can even give them a phone
call, create a task reminder,
set a meeting, and more.
In this top toolbar here,
you'll see all the
activity that has occurred
with this contact over time.
You can click on them and expand them.
You can even reply to an
email directly in this field.
You can also look at any notes,
log in and check any emails,
look at any call notes or
recorded phone calls that you had,
any tasks, or any meeting
notes that you have
from working with this customer.
You'll also see on the right hand toolbar
any deals that you have in the works,
any tickets that they have
with customer service,
or any payments that are pending
or orders or shopping carts are all
going to be shown right
here on the toolbar.
This is one of my favorites.
If you've emailed them any attachments,
all of your email attachments
are gonna show up right here
in the tab so you don't have to go search
through your inbox to find them.
The contacts are the
center of the HubSpot CRM,
and they are a super powerful way
so that all your teams can look
at a customer and see a complete
snapshot of that customer.
Now let's take a look how to
set up a company in your CRM.
Simply scroll to the top left,
click Contacts, and
scroll down to Companies.
Here you're gonna see
a very similar interface with Contacts,
so you'll see the company
name, company owner,
what data was created,
and if you wanna edit
any of these columns,
for example, maybe it's important
to me to see what industry
this company is in,
I can just drag this to
the top and click Apply.
And now I'll see that industry
is right here where I put it.
It's an easy way to customize the CRM
with this drag and drop feature.
Once you click in on a certain company,
you're gonna see a lot of information.
Again, the power of HubSpot
CRM is that anybody in your CRM
whether they're from sales,
marketing, or customer service,
they will all see the same dashboard here
and get all the same information.
So there's no loss of data.
Again, with the company,
just like with the contact,
you'll see activity, notes, emails,
calls, tasks, and meetings
in the top toolbar.
You'll also see any
contacts that are associated
with this particular company,
any deals, tickets, payments,
and some of the other features
that we saw in the contact.
And again, you can always
take action directly
in this toolbar by clicking Note.
You can just literally click
it and take a note right there.
That note will be saved in your CRM
and be visible to everybody on your team.
If you've got existing customer data
in an old CRM or in a
spreadsheet, don't worry.
It's super easy to import into HubSpot.
Let me show you how to do it.
So to get started, you're
gonna click on Contacts.
And in the top right corner,
you're gonna see a little
field that will say
Create Contact or Import.
To get started, we're gonna import.
So once I click Import, I'll
simply follow the prompts,
and it will walk me through
exactly how to import this.
We're gonna use one
spreadsheet, it's a CSV file.
We're only gonna report
on one object right now,
and we're gonna import
all of our contacts.
I'll click Next, go ahead
and choose that file,
it's right here on my
desktop called CRM Download.
Gonna make sure that I'm
updating the contacts
and it's in English.
Go ahead and click Next.
And now you'll see that
HubSpot is actually
checking for any errors in the data.
This is where it gets really cool.
HubSpot automatically maps the data fields
from your spreadsheet into HubSpot CRM.
Watch this, and you can
see that it's actually
mapped all of my fields with no errors.
First name mapped to first name,
last name to last name, et cetera.
I'll go ahead and click Next.
I'm gonna create a list in my contacts
of these new contacts.
I'm gonna agree that everybody's
waiting to hear from me
and I'm gonna set these
folks as marketing contacts
so I can send them marketing emails.
Finally, I'll click Finish Import
and watch HubSpot do the magic.
Now this takes a moment,
but you'll get an email once it's ready,
and what's even better is you'll see
how many new records you
have populating in real time.
If any records were to get
updated, it'll tell you.
And look, my import was
completed with no errors.
We are ready to go.
And now when I go back to Contacts,
and now we're gonna see all my new friends
are right here in the CRM.
However, I notice when I look at this,
it doesn't have the
information I need right away.
I'm gonna go ahead and click Edit Columns
and make this view customized
for me and my team.
First thing that's important
is it's really important
that my industry for my
customers is right up top.
Next, I really am not interested right now
in the create date, so
I can get rid of that.
But what is really important
to me is the title or their role.
I'm gonna click job title
and move that one all the
way up to the top here.
So when I look at these columns,
as you see name, email, job
title, industry, et cetera,
gonna go ahead and click Apply.
And now you can quickly see I've just
customized my dashboard, name,
email, job title, industry,
and I've got the data
that I need when I need it
in one simple place.
Let's say I wanna add
a contact on the fly,
I can simply click Create Contact,
and remember, in the CRM,
the record always goes to
the email, not the name.
So we can put in a brand new email.
I'm gonna put in my friend
fred@fredslogistics.com.
This is Fred Fahey, and I
can go ahead and make sure
that he's the COO and go
ahead and click Create
and that person is
automatically added into my CRM.
I'll see his record right here
and all of his information
is in one simple place,
easy to use.
As your business grows and
your marketing efforts evolve,
you're gonna wanna create custom lists
of people to market to or just list
of customers for your
sales team to reach out to.
Let me show you how easy it is
to create customized lists in HubSpot.
Today we're gonna build an active list
to see which customers
I've interacted with
more than 90 days ago.
To get started,
we're gonna give our list
a name, last contact,
90 days, select active
list, and click Next.
Here we'll start to add some filters
to see who's gonna make it on our list.
The first filter is I wanna
make sure the contact's
job title is either CEO or COO.
So I'll go ahead and add in CEO, COO,
or I'll even add in
Chief Operating Officer.
Here you can start to see the
list is already previewing
on the right hand side.
Next, I wanna add another filter to see
which contacts have not been
contacted in over 90 days.
So I'll select the
property, last contacted is,
down here, is more than 90 days ago
and I'll go ahead and click Enter.
And again, this is now showing
on the left that this group
title will have anybody
whose job title is CEO, COO,
or Chief Operating Officer,
and they were last contacted
more than 90 days ago.
Once I'm ready, I'll go
ahead and click Save List.
Now that we've created an active list
for prospects that we have not contacted
for more than 90 days,
as soon as they reply to
an email or email you,
they will automatically be
moved off of this active list.
This makes list maintenance easy.
It happens while you sleep, it
happens while you eat lunch,
or even drop the kids
off at soccer practice.
Your CRM is working for
you while you sleep.
Now that your contacts are
all set up in your CRM,
let's enable your sales
team to start selling
using the deals pipelines
in your HubSpot CRM.
Check it out.
To get started,
scroll up top to where it
says Sales and select Deals.
Here you'll be brought to what's
called your sales pipeline.
You can see the different
stages of a sales pipeline,
and if you wanna edit
them, it's super easy.
Click the dropdown, click Edit Pipeline,
and here you can either change
the names of the stages,
you can change the probability
that the deal will close as they go on,
and even add stages if you want to.
Since this looks good to me,
I'm gonna go back to my deal pipeline
and show you how to add a
deal to your sales pipeline.
To get started, click Create Deal.
First thing you're gonna wanna
do is give this deal a name.
So we're gonna call this
Global Logistics Deal.
We're gonna make sure it's
added to this pipeline,
and right now I've already
connected with that customer
and we've just started to
uncover their challenges.
We're estimating that this deal
is gonna be an $85,000 deal.
They are a big hotel chain that wants
to buy a bunch of donuts.
We can select a close date,
make sure I'm listed as the deal owner.
If I wanna give it a new business
or existing business label, I can.
I can give it a different priority,
and I can associate it with any contact.
So I'm gonna go ahead and
select that with, let's see,
his name was Christian, I believe.
There he is.
We're gonna go ahead and select him.
Now that we've added Chris,
we can go ahead and select a company,
add any line items from
quotes, and create that deal.
You'll notice that that deal
is gonna automatically populate
into my deal pipeline,
and it's gonna be showcased
in a whole new deal ticket.
If I click back here to Deals,
you're gonna see that this
deal is in the proper stage
in the uncover challenge pipeline.
You'll notice that it
gives me the dollar amount,
the projected close date,
and at the bottom here,
you can see very simply how
much money is in each stage
of your sales pipeline at any given time.
Now that the deal is created,
I can simply drag and drop this deal
throughout the sales
process as time goes on.
If I send a quote and it is received,
I can drop it in there.
And you'll notice at the bottom here,
the deal totals are updating every time
this moves throughout my pipeline.
Finally, that sale is closed and won,
and we are happy to add our next deal
and keep that pipeline full.
Now let's talk about reports.
A lot of organizations are
data-rich, but insight-poor.
That's not the case with HubSpot.
We have tons of pre-built
reports and dashboards ready
to enable your sales,
service, and marketing teams
with tons of great data to act on.
Let's jump in and take a look.
Simply head up to the top toolbar,
click Reports, and Dashboards.
Here you're going to see a whole list
of pre-built dashboards
with reports in them
that you can select right out of the gate.
Things like business unit
overview, chat conversions,
or if you scroll down,
you'll see all of our
different marketing dashboards
and even sales dashboards.
I'm gonna go ahead and click
on the Sales dashboard.
It includes five different reports
and I can select which
ones I wanna include
in the dashboard.
I'll simply go ahead and click Next,
select if I want it to be
private or view to everybody,
and I can give it a little
name, Sales Dashboard,
and click Create Dashboard.
Now any data that's already
in your CRM is gonna
populate directly right
into your dashboard as
soon as it's ready to go.
Dashboards are a great
way that you can look
at your CRM data in a simple,
easy to use interface.
Simply click on Reports,
look at Dashboards,
and you'll see the
dashboard that you created
with these reports.
What's nice about this
is you can drag and drop
these reports anywhere you want.
So if you wanna move them around,
if you wanna shrink them and
make them a little bit smaller,
it's totally customizable
based on your team's needs.
And that is how you use dashboards.
There's tons of automated features
and capabilities in your HubSpot CRM.
Check out our video
on how to use sales sequences
to see a great example
of automating the repetitive
parts of your sales outreach.
HubSpot CRM is built so
that it's easy to use
and adopt for your team.
It's easy for your sales, marketing,
and service team to align on customer data
in one simple platform.
And it's grown to customize
and adapt with you as your business grows.
