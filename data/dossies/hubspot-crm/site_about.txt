About Us
HubSpot’s company and culture are a lot like our product. They’re crafted, not cobbled, for a delightful experience.
Our Mission: Helping Millions of Organizations Grow Better
We believe not just in growing bigger, but in growing better. And growing better means aligning the success of your own business with the success of your customers. Win-win!
Our Story
In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way people shop and purchase products. Buyers didn’t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted helpful information. In 2006, they founded HubSpot to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound marketing.
Along the way, HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create the frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today. Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot uses its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of scaling organizations grow better.

The biggest benefit of HubSpot is that all your data lives in it, you see the same customer information as the sales team and vice versa. It gives us a new level of confidence.
Patricia Portik

HubSpot matched our expectations for several reasons. We loved its flexibility, ease of operations, and pace of scalability. It was intuitive to pick up and adopt, and had a very user-friendly interface that was easy to adapt.

Frank Loughan
VP Revenue Operations
ARC Document Solutions
HubSpot delivered an excellent level of detail, and the interface was pretty easy to use. There were 3 main reasons why we decided to adopt HubSpot — seamless collaboration between the teams, the ease of the platform, and the high level of detailing of the data.
