I'll cover the Crums you shouldn't use

you should consider like copper or
[Music]
folk here at aish app we've worked with
hundreds of businesses over the past
decade to help them set up and Implement
their CRM and we also have tens of
thousands of visitors coming to our
website with people looking for software
advice so I promise you we will not lead
you astray we're confident that you're
going to walk away from this video
knowing exactly which CRM you should use
especially if your team size is between
1 to 300 and stay until the end of the
video to hear one of the most common
mistakes that people make when setting
up their CRM all right let's get into it
before we get super deep into it let's
cover what a CRM should be used for and
you're going to see why I'm covering
this in just a moment so a CRM is used
to manage your business relationships
this can be anything from your leads to
your prospects to your vendors to your
colleagues to Partnerships and a CRM
should be the central Hub of
communication for your business meaning
that it should ingest all of your team's
communication with all the different
people that your business is interacting
with in one central place if you have
worked in sales and you've ever
contacted the same person twice and
they've replied back and said someone
from your team just messaged me
yesterday you know how unprofessional
that is and that often is the result of
a team that's not using a CRM or at
least not using it properly so when
you're choosing a CRM you want to make
sure that they're doing all of those
things that I mentioned out of the box
at the very minimum okay so which CRM
should you use now I know I know there's
so much hype around air table and
especially noce but you're going to see
in just a moment why they don't make for
great crms well the first reason why air
table and notion don't make for great
crms is because neither tool will
automatically ingest your team's emails
into the CRM this means that that super
basic feature of a customer relationship
management tool of centralizing your
communication is totally missed when
using air table or notion this also
means that you're missing out on
important information like which hot
lead you should follow up with next
because in a traditional CRM you'll be
able to see how many interactions you
had with someone when the last
interaction was when they last opened
your email are they opening your emails
but all of this data is missed out if
you're using air table or notion okay
and as a side note I have to address
this because I know there's some of you
watching that are going to say hey Andre
you know you can set up an integration
with make or zappier to ingest all of
your emails if you're using notion or
air table as a CRM instead of explaining
the Myriad of reasons why we think this
is a bad idea pause this video to see
our responses to some of these comments
in a previous video reason number two of
why you shouldn't use air table or
notion as a CRM is because they weren't
built to be a CRM Z notion is a
knowledge base not a CRM air table is
first and foremost a database which
means it helps you add more structure to
your data so think of it as a
replacement for a spreadsheet like
Google Sheets or Excel which by the way
if you're using Google Sheets or Excel
as a CRM please don't do that either and
just keep watching this video for our
recommendations of what to use instead
the tools that we'll talk about in a
second we're built to be first and
foremost customer relationship
management tools which means all of
their features actually fit Under the
Umbrella of being great crms their
entire company is dedicated to building
the best tool to help you manage
relationships so with air table or
notion you might get excited because
you're thinking wow these tools are
super flexible so I can actually built
my dream CRM for my company but what
happens in that case is you end up
turning into a product manager you are
now building a CRM instead of actually
just using a CRM that was built now this
is especially problematic if you're a
business owner because my bet is your
time is way better spent actually doing
sales or training your team to do better
sales rather than than building a
software tool especially if your
business has nothing to do with building
customer relationship management tools
okay so now that we've gotten the tools
that we don't recommend you using out of
the way let's talk about the tools we do
recommend PS if you've learned something
so far please like And subscribe it just
supports us and it allows us to make
more content like this okay so let's
talk about folk folk is a fantastic CRM
if you are an individual or a small team
that is really focused on contact
management and building relationships if
you clicked on this video and you are
even remotely considering using notion
or air table as a CRM folk is going to
be our top recommendation for you and
that's because the tool is actually
built similar to a database structure it
actually allows you to bulk update
fields and edit data in line just like
you would in a spreadsheet or a database
so with all of that it's going to feel
the most familiar all while having those
really powerful CRM features built in
setting up folk is is incredibly easy
they have dozens of pre-built templates
that you can use for different processes
that are basically just plug-and-play so
with folk you really have a great
Foundation out of the gate it also has a
beautiful minable interface and great
design which we love one of my favorite
features when it comes to folk is how
easy it is to add contacts I'd say folk
is probably the friendliest CRM when it
comes to adding contacts into the tool
they have a Chrome extension and once
you've installed it there's a button
that appear years whether you're in
Gmail LinkedIn or X that says add to
folk and you literally have it
integrated with all of these tools right
there done for you once you've added the
contact to folk you can use their inrich
feature which helps you more easily find
the right email address or their job
title or their phone number Etc if you
want to bulk email a group of contacts
folk will allow you to do that and you
can also set reminders to follow up with
people one-on-one specifically honestly
for sales teams especially sales teams
that aren't using a CRM at all folk will
feel like a game changer another cool
thing about folk is that they're
experimenting with some AI features to
help improve your experience within the
tool while it still has a way to go it's
far from perfect you can experiment with
it by inserting your own prompts and
different variables where this could
come in handy is if you want to use the
AI feature to generate an email that
you're going to bulk send to a bunch of
people or a social media DM while the
drafts aren't perfect they will will
help you get the ball rolling and at
least get you start thinking perhaps in
the right direction if you are a
solopreneur or a small team that is
really wanting just a structured tool to
help you better manage your contacts and
relationships would highly recommend
folk it's great for fundraising basic
Recruitment and just managing all of
your relationships in one place to give
folk a shot use our affiliate link down

your first year so what if you're a team
that's looking for a CRM that goes
beyond contact management something that
will be really powerful when it comes to
Integrations reporting and workflow
automations in this case you might want
to consider copper or pipe Drive we've
been a partner with copper for over
eight years we're actually their first
Integrations partner you're going to
find with copper they're a more
traditional CRM you're going to have
your typical structure of your leads
your people your companies and your
opportunities like for example if you
want a more simple to use alternative to
HubSpot or Salesforce then copper or
pipe Drive are going to be two really
great choices now as a heads up copper
only works with Google workspace and
that is our Preferred Choice because we
love Google workspace but if you are on
Microsoft 365 then definitely check out
pipe Drive they are very similar and in
this video while I'll mainly talk about
copper because it's what we use more so
here just replace copper with pipe drive
because they're very similar in their
functionality we recommend that teams
use copper that are looking to really
map their processes out to a CRM so this
means that you first of all know your
processes or you're on your way to
knowing your processes really well and
you're looking for a powerful CRM that
can really serve as the foundation for
you to integrate other tools with it
like for example your invoicing software
like zero or QuickBooks or your
Voiceover IP like Dad or air call or E
signature tools like panad do or
Ironclad like if you're looking for a
central tool that can integrate well
with all these thirdparty tools then
copper is a really awesome Choice we've
seen a lot of agencies financial
planners home service companies have
great success with copper and I'm going
to take you through an example of an
entire workflow so you can really get a
picture of what I'm talking about when I
talking about Integrations so let's take
a home services company they have a
website and somebody fills out a form on
their website well that form is
integrated in with the CRM copper and
all of their data appears in the lead
section so the team knows to follow up
you may also have automated emails going
out to follow up with them as well from
there they might automatically get sent
a scheduling link where they can book in
a home visit and then your team would go
out assess if they're a qualified lead
and if they are they would get converted
into a person perhaps a company and an
opportunity and from there you're going
to take them through your sales process
and perhaps one of those stages is to
create a proposal if you're using
something like panad do that integrates
in with copper you're going to have a
really easy time automatically pulling
contact details for example straight
from copper into panad do we've seen
team Save hours when using panad do and
copper together perhaps after you send
out the proposal you want some automated
follow-up emails to go out to that lead
to make sure that they are viewing the
proposal and to check in with them to
see if they want a close and in a
perfect world now they close so they've
signed their e signature document and
you want to send them an invoice you can
move move one opportunity to the next
stage that says invoice sent and an
integration can automatically create
that in your accounting software and
send it off to them so hopefully this
gives you a picture of what I'm talking
about from start to finish the CRM being
the foundation of all of this but you
have these other tools integrated in so
it makes a really seamless workflow
experience for your team and also your
customer another main difference between
folk and copper is that copper has
something called workflow automations
and there's dozens uses for them you can
create autotask so when a lead comes in
a task is created for someone on your
team or when an opportunity gets to a
stage your team member gets assigned a
bunch of tasks or you can autocreate an
opportunity Etc there's honestly dozens
of uses and finally if you're interested
in reporting at all copper is going to
be your best bet in this case because
they have some pretty Advanced reporting
capabilities now as long as you know
your way around and know how to set it
up all that being said if you want to
give copper or pipe drive a shot then
use the the link Down Below in our
description and if you decide to go with
copper and you use our affiliate link to
sign up you'll receive our $1,200 copper
crash course for free after your first
paid month the course will cover our
best practices to help you set up your
CRM now if you're a very small team like
under 300 employees using the CRM we
don't recommend HubSpot or Salesforce
because they can get very expensive very
quickly you can check out this article
where we go into a lot more detail on
this and now for your bonus tip of where
most people make a huge mistake when
setting up and using their CRM a lot of
the time we see that teams rely way too
much on individual tasks to move things
forward in the CRM when you assign
yourself a task for every single contact
for example or opportunity what happens
is you typically have a bunch of overdue
tasks and all of them are falling by the
wayside so we encourage teams to think
of their processes more in terms of
groups of tasks rather than individual
tasks so for example in a typical sales
process you would have proposal sent or
invoice sent and Within These stages you
have within your process your business
process documented all the steps that
need to get done in order to move this
opportunity to the next stage so this
takes it from Individual tasks that are
everywhere to groups of tasks that live
under one stage in your CRM and this way
you can also see at a top level an
overview of where everything is in your
process and another hot tip is when you
set up your CRM this way it also leaves
a great opportunity for automation
because for example if you have a stage
called invoice sent and you're doing
that manually we can also use that in
the future perhaps when you scale to
trigger an integration with QuickBooks
online or zero to automatically create
and send that invoice for you come on
that's pretty cool right yeah so as a
summary for this video do not use air
table or notion as your CRM you're going
to spend way too much time configuring
the CRM trying to train your team which
will likely lead to poor or no adoption
leaving you in the same place as you
started let us save you the time and the
hours of going down that path and
instead just use a CRM a tool that was
built for the job from the start they
say if you're going to do something do
it right and that's what you're going to
be doing with either folk or copper
because they're both great
choices all right now that you know
which CRM to use Maybe you're looking
for a project management tool to help
you get your work done more efficiently
as well and if you are make sure that
