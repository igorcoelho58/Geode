The start of things
When founders Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein met, they were leading engineering teams at Facebook. As Facebook grew (and grew fast), they discovered everyone was spending over half the day sitting in meetings, responding to email, and searching for info. Doing skilled work was taking a backseat to distracting "work about work."
So Dustin and JR built a tool to make it easier for teams to coordinate work. The result not only gave their teams clarity about what to do and why, but also time back to focus on the big ideas. Dustin and JR were inspired. Soon after, they founded Asana to spend their time building solutions to help more teams do the great work—without the busywork.
What's in a name?
Asana is a Sanskrit word that refers to the place and pose in which a yogi sits. A pose requires marrying form and flow to stay centered while moving through distractions. Our founders chose it to describe what they set out to build, a product that brings, ease, focus and flow to you, your team, and your work.
We typically pronounce Asana with the emphasis on the second syllable: uh-sāh-nuh. But we’re not prescriptive about it. We welcome other pronunciations too, including the Sanskrit pronunciation āh-suh-nuh.
