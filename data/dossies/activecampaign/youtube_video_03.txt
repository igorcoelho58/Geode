Hey there, Lissette for Tooltester.
Today, we're charging into a battle between two 
popular all-in-one marketing platforms: HubSpot  
and ActiveCampaign. Both are powerful tools that 
can help your business thrive, but they each  
have their own strengths and weaknesses.So let's 
dive into their pros and cons, so you can decide  
which one is best for your business needs, and 
avoid paying extra for features you don’t need!
To start, let's look at each platform’s 
editor and their email templates. 
HubSpot’s email editor is user-friendly, 
allowing you to save custom blocks for  
future use. In terms of templates, it offers 
15 modern, customizable designs to create  
visually appealing emails. However, these are, 
unfortunately, only available on their Marketing  
hub starter plan. Their free plan offers 
just a handful of very simple templates. 
ActiveCampaign, on the other hand, offers more 
than 250 email templates and an easy-to-use  
email editor with advanced features, 
such as its impressive countdown timer,  
which literally provides your audience a realtime 
countdown to a special event. . ActiveCampaign  
also allows you to create your own templates from 
scratch using plain layouts or custom HTML code,  
which gives you a lot of creative control. It’s 
worth mentioning that HTML email creation is only  
possible with Hubspot’s pricier Professional 
and Enterprise plans, whereas you can do this  
with ActiveCampaign even on its cheapest plan..
Though ActiveCampaign’s abundant features could  
be a bit overwhelming for beginners 
at first, it’s worth investing the  
time to up your email marketing game!
Overall, ActiveCampaign offers more  
flexibility when it comes to design, and therefore 
takes the first point in this head to head.
Now, let's compare what everyone’s here 
for: their automation capabilities. 
HubSpot offers robust automation workflows that 
are customizable. From sending abandoned cart  
reminders to post-purchase follow-ups, Hubspot 
provides y everything you need to scale up your  
business... well for a price that is. To access 
unlimited and omnichannel automations, you’ll  
need to upgrade to their expensive Professional 
plan. Activecampaign is a much better value for  
money here, as you’ll have access to unlimited 
automation features for a fraction of the price. 
ActiveCampaign is actually known for its strong 
marketing automation features and offers hundreds  
of pre-built workflows that you can fully 
customize. These include abandoned cart,  
SMS, lead scoring and sales automations 
- there is actually very little you  
can’t automate with Activecampaign.
That’s why we’ve awarded Activecampaign  
the point here too, Taking the score to 2 - 0.
Next up, Segmentation. This feature is key for  
sending targeted emails to your subscribers.
HubSpot offers decent segmentation,  
allowing you to group contacts based on their 
behavior and characteristics. It's good,  
but not as intuitive as ActiveCampaign’s.
In fact, ActiveCampaign shines in this  
department. For example, its tagging system lets 
you easily group contacts based on labels you’ve  
assigned. With HubSpot, this is possible 
but not as straightforward to accomplish. 
That’s another point to ActiveCampaign, 
taking the score to 3 - 0 
Moving on to Reporting: HubSpot puts the power 
in your hands when it comes to reporting. It lets  
you customise your dashboard to see various 
reports all at once and get a clear snapshot  
of what's hitting the mark and what's not. 
Plus, with sales rep performance insights,  
it makes it clear to you who's shining and 
who may need some help. And the cherry on  
top? You can also manage the privacy of your 
reports, choosing exactly who gets a peek. 
Now with ActiveCampaign, you're never 
in the dark, either. You can dive deep  
into reports covering everything from 
contacts, deals, and email newsletters,  
to automation and e-commerce. But here's their 
star: the Deal Task Overview Report. It lets you  
tap into crucial CRM task data and results, which 
helps you stay informed and on top of your goals.
Though both do really well in this 
area, Hubspot wins this round due to a  
better design and readability. Meaning Hubspot 
scores its first point for a new total of 3:1 
In terms of CRM, ActiveCampaign brings a lot 
of flexibility to your deal pipeline. You get  
the power to customize stages according to 
your sales process and even create multiple  
pipelines for different products or services. 
And, the drag-and-drop mechanism is intuitive,  
making deal management a breeze.
Now, HubSpot also lets you customize  
stages and throws more filters into the mix. And 
although the free plan is limited to one pipeline,  
their Starter plan steps up to two pipelines. We 
also love its the drag-and-drop feature, similar  
to Trello’s, which keeps deal progression simple.
It's a close call, but HubSpot slightly edges  
ahead regarding customization 
and pipeline management. 
That makes the score a close 
3 - 2 to ActiveCampaign. Looks  
like Hubpot is quickly catching up!
But who will come out on top when it comes 
to pricing? HubSpot offers various plans,  
including a free option with limited features. 
Of course, the more advanced the features the  
more you’ll have to pay, and we can tell you 
that Hubpot’s Professional plan is not cheap. 
ActiveCampaign doesn't have a free plan and 
requires the Plus plan for e-commerce integration,  
but don’t let that dissuade you. Like with 
Hubspot, you can purchase the marketing and  
sales products separately, or bundle them 
together so you only pay for what you need.  
And, while ActiveCampaign may be more 
expensive if you have smaller marketing lists,  
it becomes more cost-effective as you scale up.
If we compare their Marketing-only plans,  
and take a look at the features offered 
on the Professional tiers, you’ll see  
that they really aren’t that different. 
What is wildly different is the price tag. 
ActiveCampaign is the clear winner 
here, maintaining its lead at 4 - 2.
Just a quick caveat: Note that these 
prices could change at any moment,  
so please check our website 
for the most up-to-date prices.
To quickly summarize:
HubSpot shines with its strong CRM 
features, easy-to-use platform,  
and excellent reports. This is great if 
you’re looking for an all-in-one solution. 
But it falls short in its lower tier plans 
which only include basic templates And,  
its incredibly high costs for automation 
and other advanced marketing features,  
make it out of reach for small businesses.
ActiveCampaign, is the go-to software for  
businesses who want to take their email 
marketing to the next level. It provides  
excellent design options, advanced segmentation, 
automations, and comprehensive reports.
And while its complexity 
might overwhelm beginners,  
and it doesn’t offer a free plan, 
ActiveCampaign comes out on top. 
With a final score of 4 to 2, it 
beats Hubspot by twice as many points.
