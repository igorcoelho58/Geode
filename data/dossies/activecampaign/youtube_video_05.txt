everything you need to know to get
started with the marketing automation
tool active campaign this is a
step-by-step tutorial that is designed
to guide you through literally
everything from setting up your account
to creating your first email campaigns
and automations so here's a quick
rundown of what we'll be covering in
this tutorial how to set up your active
campaign account how to import and
manage your contacts how to connect
activecampaign to your website how to
create a custom landing page how to send
out email campaigns how to create
Automation workflows and lastly how to
manage your leads in the active campaign
CRM tool to save you some time I've
included timestamps for each topic Down
Below in the video description so if
you're looking for a specific part you
can just go directly there so without
further Ado let's Jump Right In and get
started with this active campaign
tutorial so the first thing we're going
to do is get us a 14 day free trial for
activecampaign so go to the description
of this video and click on the first
link you find there this will take you
to the correct sign up page where you
can claim your free trial alright so
once you're on this page let's get
signed up for a new active campaign
account just come over here type in your
email address and click on get started
then here we have to type in our name
and phone number and click on next step
and then we have to answer a couple of
questions about our business so let's
just do that once you've answered all
the questions just click on next step
and here choose a password for your
active campaign account once that's done
let's click on take me to my account and
this will take us inside of the
activecampaign dashboard which is what
you're going to see whenever you log in
to your active campaign account so here
on the left side we have the active
campaign tools which you're going to use
to create campaigns spilled automations
manage contacts and so on I'm not going
to go into each of them just right now
because throughout the tutorial I'm
going to cover pretty much all of them
then on the bottom left we have some
settings which we're going to go into in
just a moment we have your account
settings here on the bottom left and
then whenever you want to contact
support if you need help with something
then you just want to go to the bottom
right corner where you can see this
active campaign logo click here and then
you can start a chat with the
activecampaign support which is really
good so whenever you want to build
something custom and you don't know how
to do it just contact support and they
will help you out alright now before we
go into how to build campaigns and how
to manage your contacts and so on we
need to go into the settings and look at
some basic default settings so let's go
to the bottom left and click on settings
here and here in the settings there's
two main things we want to do before
we're able to send out email campaigns
on activecampaign so let's come over
here here to Advanced and then let's go
to email domain verification here is
where you can type in the email that
will be seen as the sender for every
email campaign that you send out for
example my domain is medicsmedia.com so
I want people to see that the email is
coming from let's say info
medicsmedia.com or Simon medicsmedia.com
so this is the email that I'll use
to send out my email campaigns so I'm
just going to type in that email here
and then I'm going to click on submit
now we can see an email has been sent to
verify this domain now we need to go
into the inbox of this specific email
and confirm that we actually have access
to this domain and this email so you
should be getting an email that looks
like this where you can just click on
verify and this will take us back to our
activecampaign account where now we can
see that our email domain
medicsmedia.com is now now verified and
we can use it to send out emails using
activecampaign now if you don't already
have your own domain like
medicsmedia.com then you can also use
your regular email like a Gmail address
or a Hotmail whatever you're using type
that in here and then verify it just the
same way as we've done before and
however I do recommend you get your own
branded custom domain because it
increases your deliverability rates for
your email campaigns and it also looks a
lot more professional for your customers
and now the next thing we want to do is
go to addresses here and then here we
have to add a physical business address
that will then be visible at the bottom
of every email campaign that you send
out this is mandatory so you're gonna
need to add an address if you want to be
able to send out email campaigns using
activecampaign so let's just click on
add an address here on the top right
then just type in your business address
I've just typed in something random and
click on ADD address and then the last
thing we want to also do is go to
appearance and then scroll all the way
down and make sure to turn off the
active campaign branding if you leave it
on then your email contacts will just
randomly see the active campaign logo in
your campaigns and we can actually just
turn this off here and that was already
it for the basic setup so let's go back
to the main dashboard by going to the
activecampaign logo on the top left so
next let's look at how to import and
manage your contacts on an active
campaign so on the left side menu let's
click on contacts and then here you can
see an overview of all of the contacts
that you currently have on
activecampaign so right now we only have
our own email address that refuse to
sign up with for activecampaign and then
there's nothing else because we haven't
imported anything yet now as you can see
here active campaign actually offers you
to help you migrate your your lists and
your automations from another provider
into activecampaign and if you're
interested in that just click on request
a free migration here and then I think
depending on the plan that you choose
they will help you set everything up the
same way as you had it on the other
provider so that's really helpful but in
my case I'm just going to click on no
thanks here so the way contacts are
managed on activecampaign is very
similar compared to other providers like
when we go to lists here on the top left
we can see all of our email lists our
contact lists Now by default we have
this master contact list here where
currently we have one contact which is
us and if you want to you can create
more lists so you can have a list for
let's say people interested in a
specific course people interested in
another product so that's really up to
you so if you want to create a new list
just click on ADD list here on the top
right and then create whatever list you
want personally I prefer to manage my
contacts using tags rather than lists so
when we go to under manage we can click
on tags and then you can see you can add
specific tags so for example if I have
somebody interested in email marketing I
will create an a tag called email
marketing and I will add that tag and
then whenever somebody signs up through
a specific funnel that is about email
marketing I will assign that tag to that
person so I actually don't need multiple
email lists I can just send a campaign
to everybody who has a specific tag so
that's why I personally only use one
list to keep things kind of organized so
I'm not going to create any other lists
I'm just going to work with the master
contact list here that we already have
and then under manage you already you
also have other ways on how you can
manage your contacts which I'm not going
to go in detail here but what I want to
show you is how to import your existing
contacts to activecampaign if you are
migrating from another provider if you
don't have any contact you yet just skip
to the next part of this tutorial so to
import contacts just click on contacts
here on the top left and then on the top
right we can see add a contact or import
now if you want to you can just click on
add a contact and then add each single
contact manually which you probably
don't want to do because it just takes
too long so what we're going to do is
just click on import on the top right
and then we're going to import a file
that we can export from the other
provider so let's say you've been using
MailChimp or convertkit you can just
export all of your contacts as a CSV
file and then you want to download
download that file and then once you've
downloaded that you can just go come
here click on import from file and then
you want to look for that file so I've
just created an example file here here
and click on open now just to show you
how this looks like the file that you're
going to be importing it's basically
just like an Excel sheet where you have
your contact email address you have the
name and you have other information like
where they're from what they're
interested in the tags that you gave
them and so on so once you've imported
that file this is what you're going to
see so all of the columns that we've
seen before we can also see here as
lines and now we want to make sure to
import every attribute of our contacts
correctly so here we can see the column
says name and then we want to make sure
it actually saves this information as
name also an activecampaign so name is
first name that's fine because I only
asked for the first name and then email
is going to be email address that's
obvious that's great now let's scroll
down and you want to just look at the
ones that are assigned so custom birth
date is going to be subscribe date so
here you can see that's wrong so you can
either just create a new field here and
add the information birth date so it
takes it over correctly or you can just
not import this information if it's not
important to you so personally I don't
really care about the birth date of my
leads or my contacts so I just choose do
not import this field and then I'm going
to go down and then we have last update
it will save it as the last name which
is wrong so let's just do not import
this field either so all I'm interested
in is the email address and the name
which we have here once we've checked
this we can choose the list that we want
to put those contacts on so let's choose
our Master contact list then we can also
add tags so this is what I showed you
before to basically segment your lists
now for example we could add a tag which
says imported from let's say MailChimp
so let's say imported from MailChimp and
hit enter and then we always know that
everybody who has that tag was imported
from MailChimp all right so that's all
fine let's click on import now on the
bottom right and now it says that your
import has been completed so we can go
to to lists and then click on our Master
contact list and then we can see the
newly imported contacts that we just
imported now the next thing I want to
show you is how to connect
activecampaign to Wordpress so what
we're going to do is just create a
simple Forum that we can then put on our
website and then people can just type in
their email address click on submit and
then they will end up on your email list
on your email newsletter if you don't
have a website and you want to use a
landing page instead and you want to
build it with activecampaign then just
skip ahead to the next part because I'm
also going to show you how to do that
but now to connect your website to
activecampaign we want to come over here
or first of all we can go back to the
dashboard here by clicking on the
activecampaign logo and then we want to
go to website and then here we can see
that we have two options we have forms
and we have pages so if you already have
a website then you just need to create a
form and put it on your website but if
you need to create a website like a
landing page then you want to click on
pages but we're going to create a form
so we're going to stick here to forms so
let's just click on create a new form
and then we have to first give our form
a name so let's just say default sign up
form and we also have different form
Styles so we have the inline form which
is great to put like on a blog post we
have the floating bar where you can see
just a bar at the top of the website to
ask people to sign up or we have the
floating box on the bottom right or we
have the modal option which just pops up
in the center of the screen I'm going to
show you how to create a simple inline
form so I'm going to click on inline
form and then we also already have to
define the action what will happen to
the people who sign up on that form so
the easiest thing you can do is just
subscribe it to a list so subscribe to a
list and we only have one list currently
so it's going to be the master contact
list you can also add multiple actions
so you can add it to other lists as well
or you can tag them whatever you want so
that's good for me so I'm just going to
click on Create and this will take us to
the activecampaign form Builder where we
can design this sign up Forum that will
put on our website so the first thing we
want to do here is click on options here
on the top right and then where it says
on submit this is where you can Define
what should happen when somebody
actually types in their email address
and clicks on submit so by default they
will just see this message here thanks
for signing up if you want to change the
text you can just change the text here
or if you want to send people to a
specific website when they sign up then
you can just switch this to open URL and
then type in the URL here wherever you
want to send people when they submit
their email address I'm just going to
leave it at show thank you so they
actually stay on the page where they
sign up then we also want to click on
this gear icon here where it says opt-in
options and here here is where you can
turn on or turn off the opt-in
confirmation so by default the opt-in
confirmation is turned on which means
that whenever somebody signs up using
this form they will get an email to have
them confirm that they actually want to
be on your email list so this has an
advantages and disadvantages the
advantage is that you only get people
who really want to be on your list but
the disadvantage is that if people don't
confirm on that email then this person
won't be on your list and you can send
them follow-up emails so what I
personally do is just turn this off and
then in my welcome email I let everybody
know that they can unsubscribe at any
time at the bottom of every email this
way I don't lose any contacts but that's
really up to you so let's click on Save
now let's click on style here in the
center and then scroll all the way down
and then we want to uncheck the AC
branding the active campaign branding we
also want to make sure we can actually
click the button and this will just get
rid of the active campaign logo at the
bottom of your form now the next step is
to actually customize the form to what
you want it to look like so let's click
on fields and then here we can see
different things we can ask in the form
so by default it just asks for the name
and the email address I'm just going to
show you how to create a very simple
form that looks very minimalistic and
clean so first I'm not going to ask for
the name so I'm just going to click on
the X here and remove the name and then
I'm going to click on the email field
here and I'm just going to delete the
header as well and then the header will
be gone I'm just going to type in email
here so then they can see email here in
the in the field itself and then I'm
going to delete this message here also
and I'm just gonna change the title here
to let's say subscribe for
our email mail news letter or whatever
you want to add here you can also just
delete it all together and then just add
the text on your website the next thing
is I want to change some of the design
options so what you can do is just go to
style and then play around with the
colors here the button color for example
we can change this to let's make this
let's say green like this and just play
around with it until it looks like you
want it to look now with this Builder
it's kind of cumbersome but if you want
to change for example if you want to
make the button a bit larger we're going
to have to add some custom CSS code so
I'm just going to show you what I would
do so I'm just going to go to the
inspector and then I'm going to click on
this text field here and I'm going to
make the email text go into the center
by just typing in text
hyphen align Colon Center and then
semicolon and then you can see the email
text will be in the center and then I'm
again going to click on the inspector
click on the button and then here I'm
going to change the width to 100 so I'm
going to type in width 100 percent
semicolon and just like that we have the
button just all the with the entire
width so you can play around with this
however you want to if you want to do
something and you don't know how to do
it just click on this button here
contact support and then they will
definitely help you to create the Forum
exactly how you want it to look like so
let's say we're done with the form here
so let's click on integrate here on the
top right so now let's look at how to
put that form that we've just created
onto your website so one way is to just
copy the HTML code that you can see here
and then put it in the HTML code of your
website however that's not really the
best way so what you want to do is look
if your website builder has an
integration with activecampaign which a
lot of website Builders do and then
install that integration and then it's
going to be a lot easier to connect your
forms to your website now I'm going to
show you how to do it on a WordPress
website and use the activecampaign
plugin on WordPress so I have one
example WordPress site here where we're
going to install the activecampaign
plugin so let's just go to plugins and
click on add new here and then let's
search for active campaign and there we
go this is the the plugin we need to
install so let's just click on install
now so now the plugin is installed next
we need to connect this plugin with our
activecampaign account so let's go to
settings and then go to activecampaign
and then we have to copy and paste the
API URL and the API key from our
activecampaign account to these fields
here so let's go to our activecampaign
account and we can actually click on
save and exit then here we want to go
all the way to the bottom left where it
says as settings then let's go to
developer and then here we can see the
API access so the URL let's just click
on copy API URL paste it in here and
then also copy the API key and paste it
in here and then click on connect then
scroll down and click on update settings
and now activecampaign is connected to
our WordPress website so now to put your
form onto your website we can for
example go to our posts and then I'm
just going to go to this first example
post here and now we have the plugin
installed so we can just use the plugin
to add any form that we have on our
activecampaign account and add it to our
website so if I want to have the form
just like under this text here I just
click on the plus sign here on the
bottom left and I'm just going to look
for active campaign there we go here AC
form so let's click on AC forms and then
here I can choose the Forum that we've
created the default signup form and
there we go now we have the form that we
have created on our WordPress website to
make this active let's click on update
and now let's actually check if our form
works so let's go back to the WordPress
dashboard then let's go to this post and
then just type in an example address
just to see if it works I'm just going
to type an example at gmail.com and
click on submit and now we can see the
thank you message that we've seen before
and now we should be able to go back to
uh to activecampaign go to contacts and
now we can see example gmail.com is now
in our contacts so the form works so now
let's look at how to create a landing
page on activecampaign so to create a
landing page let's click on website on
the left side menu and now we're going
to switch from forms to Pages then let's
click on create create a new page then
click add new page and then here you
have a lot of different templates for
all kinds of different landing pages or
you can also just start with a blank
template now in this example I'm just
going to choose one of the templates so
for example this asset download one this
is a good template for people who want
to basically give away a lead magnet for
the contact so an ebook a checklist or
something like that so let's click on
use this template and then let's name
this page so let's say we're giving away
a checklist so I just named this
checklist download landing page and
click on Save and this takes us inside
of the website or landing page builder
this is kind of very similar compared to
other website Builders if you've used
some of them before so basically you
have a preview of everything here in the
center then on the right side you have
different blocks and elements you can
basically add to your website and you
here in the top you can switch from
desktop view to mobile view as well if
you get a lot of traffic from mobile you
definitely want to optimize your site
for mobile as well so let's just switch
back to desktop then here on theme you
can change all the colors so I'm just
going to build something very simple so
I'm just going to first of all delete
everything that I don't need I'm just
going to hit the trash icon here for
everything I don't need so I'm just
going to do something very simple for
the sake of this tutorial I'm also going
to delete the logo and actually this
entire area and I'm going to leave this
picture here so obviously you want to
add a mock-up or whatever you're using
like a picture of what you're giving
away or what your landing page is about
you just click on it click on replace
here and then upload whatever image you
want to use so I'm just going to change
this text here to let's say
increase here you want to obviously
enter the main benefit of whatever your
landing page is about so what you're
giving away so let's say increase your
sales by I don't know 312 percent in one
month
implementing my optimization
optimization checklist and that's going
to be the title and now on this side
here we're going to add a form so the
form is what people will be using to
type in their information so we're gonna
click on inline form here and we're
actually going to drag this to this side
here and then we can either use a form
that we've already built so we've
already have this form built here so I
could just use that or I can build a new
form so let's click on build a new form
and then we're going to give that form a
name let's say landing page form and
whenever somebody signs up to this for
in this form then let's say they will
subscribe to the master contact list
let's click on start building and this
will take us back to the form Builder
that I've already showed you how to
customize your form to make it look
exactly how you want it to look like now
what I want to mention here is that if
you're using a landing page a lot of the
times you want people to get to the next
page once they enter their details so
for example if you're saying give me
your email address to see this video
then after they enter the email address
then they will get to the page where
they can see the video or you will send
in the video however you want to do it
but you want to make sure to go to
options and then if you want to send
them to a specific page you want to not
just show a thank you message when they
sign up you want to probably and send
them to a specific URL so you want to
type in that URL here which is going to
be the second step of your funnel so
after the landing page now you can also
build your next step here on
activecampaign and then you can just
type come later on back to this form and
put in the URL of that second page into
this field and then whenever they sign
up on your landing page they will get to
the second page which you can build
after that so let's just type in Google
just because I don't already have that
page yet and then let's click on add to
your page and this will add the new form
to our page and let's just delete this
one as well so now we have a very simple
landing page where we just have one
sentence why they should sign up an
image of what we're giving away and then
the form where they can sign up so now
let's click on publish page here on the
top right and this will give us the URL
that we that our landing page will be on
we can also use our own domain if we
have one and then we can have that
landing page under our own domain but
let's now publish it under this
activecampaign domain click on publish
and now we can click on view live here
and on the top right to check if our
landing page works so let's just type in
name and then email example2 gmail.com
click on submit and now as you can see
we get redirected to Google because
that's the URL that we've typed in for
the on submit option so let's go back go
to contacts and now we can see Simon
with example2 gmail.com is in our
contact so the landing page works but
now we can actually go back to website
and go to pages and now we can create
the second page of the funnel so we can
click on add a new page and then maybe
we can go we can use this template here
asset download 2 use this template then
let's say this is the funnel step two
click on Save and then we obviously want
to customize this second page as well
once it's done let's click on publish
page here on the top upright and just
publish it again on the activecampaign
domain let's click publish and now let's
connect these two pages that we've
created so let's go back to Pages here
and then here we can see the first page
the checklist download landing page and
then the funnel step two now let's go to
this Arrow go to get URL and copy this
URL and now we want to have everybody
who signs up on this page get redirected
to the second step of the funnel so we
have to go to forms because people type
in their their information on the form
and I've used this one landing page form
two so let's click on edit here and then
let's go to options and we gonna change
this on submit URL to the one we have
just copied before we're just going to
paste it in click on integrate save and
exit so now when we go back to pages and
then visit the landing page here now
let's just type in something random and
click on submit and now as you can see
we get taken to the second page that
we've created before which is the second
step of the funnel now for those of you
who want to connect your custom domain
to your landing page I'm going to leave
a link with some instructions on how to
do that in the video description below
and I believe you also need to be on the
activecampaign plus plan so that you're
able to connect your own custom domain
to your pages so now let's look at how
to send out email campaigns on
activecampaign so to create and send
campaigns we want to go to the left side
menu and click on campaigns and then to
create our first campaign let's click
create your first campaign here we're
going to give our campaign a name so
let's just say this is going to be a
Weekly Newsletter let's say this is
number eight and then we have different
campaign types so we have the standard
Campaign which is just like a one-time
email like a newsletter then we have the
automated campaign this is the
automation email workflow which
activecampaign is a very good ad and I'm
going to show you exactly how to build a
workflow in the next part then we have
the autoresponder which is just a
sequence of emails that will go out when
somebody subscribes to your list so you
can build it out using autoresponder you
can do split testing so you can try
different types of emails and then
compare the performance to see which
type of email campaign works the best
you can have RSS triggered emails and
then you can have date based campaigns
that just go out for when let's say your
contacts have a birthday then it will
send them like a birthday discount or
something like that but for now let's
stick with the standard campaign so
let's choose this and then click on next
on the top right and then here we have
to choose who will be receiving this
specific email that we're about to
create as we only have one list
currently we can only choose the master
contact list and if you have different
tags for your context you can also
segment their recipients by the tags as
well then let's click on next and then
here we want to choose what type of
email editor we want to use to create
our email so with the email Designer you
have a lot more freedom so you can add
images buttons graphics and make your
email look very nice and then you also
have the text only editor which is great
for if you only want to write a text
email with maybe a few links so I'm
going to show you how to use the email
Designer because the text only one is
really easy to use so let's click on
continue here and then you can either
start with a template from
activecampaign which you can see here or
you can click on start from scratch I'm
gonna just use a template so I'm going
to use the Weekly Newsletter template
here click on select and then here we
have to enter our sender details so the
name I would change this to let's say
Simon from Medics media and then the
from email is the email that people will
see where this email comes from so I
want to change this to my branded email
which is Simon admatics media.com and
I've already verified this email in the
beginning of the video if you haven't
done this then you can still do it here
and then the email subject is obviously
very important with email marketing so
let's say these let's say AI tools are
changing my life just so people want to
click on this email and click on
continue and this takes us into the
email editor where we can start
designing our email so this is quite
similar to creating pages on
activecampaign you basically start with
a template that you've chosen here when
you want to change something just click
on it and then you can either just
change the text by just highlighting it
and then writing whatever you want here
on the top you also have some formatting
options like underlining adding links
and so on then on the right side you
have more options so you can change the
background color alignment spacing and
so on if you want to change your picture
just click on let's for example say logo
and then change your logo here if you
want to add something new just go to
content and then blocks and then drag in
whatever you want to add for example we
could add a timer here below the button
just drag and drop it into the email
canvas then you can just click on the
element and then choose for example here
when the timer should go to zero so a
lot of options here with this email
Designer you also have structures so if
you want to have a two column design you
can just drag in this design here then
you have two columns you can add then
you can add blocks so let's say on the
left side we have a text on the right
side we have an image and you can just
build out your email the same way as you
build out a simple page you also have
the global settings here on the on the
top right where you can just go through
and just make sure everything is kind of
branded to how you want it to look you
can also preview your email to see how
it looks like by going on this preview
icon on the top right and then you're
going to see a preview of your email on
mobile and also on desktop you can also
click on this test email button here and
then send this email to your own address
to see exactly how it looks like on your
email provider inbox so let's say we're
done creating our email so then we can
just go to the top right and click on
next and this will take us to the
campaign summary where we just want to
quickly review before we send our
campaign so the subject looks fine then
we have to pre-header text we don't have
anything in here yet but we can actually
add something by clicking on edit and
then we can add a preview of the content
of the email so let's say we add
something like the first AI tool that
changed my live is dot dot dot so people
will actually see that sentence before
they open the email so that kind of
helps entice people to actually click on
the email which is very useful so let's
click on Save then again go to next and
now as you can see we have this sentence
as the pre-headed text then the from
email looks fine the list looks also
fine address this is the default address
of the business that we've set up before
that's mandatory then we have some
options like we want to track if people
open the email and then if you have
links you can also add link tracking to
see who actually clicked on a link in
the email which is also very useful so
just go through these options here you
can again send a test email to your own
account if you want to preview the email
whatever you need to do and then we also
have the spam check and if it's passed
and it's good if it doesn't then you
want to maybe go go back change some
words like you don't want to add things
like three or maybe add too many images
because if you do then the email will
just end up spam folder but here it
looks good so we can now either we can
schedule the email by just typing in
when we want to have this email to be
sent so let's say tomorrow at this time
we can just turn this on and then it
would be sent at a specific time or we
could send it now so let's just click on
send now to have this campaign send to
this email list and now under campaigns
we can see our first email campaign The
Weekly Newsletter 8 which is currently
preparing to send now once it's sent and
you've waited some time you can actually
check the performance of your email by
just going to reports here on the left
side where we should now be able to see
that email that we've just sent out so
as I've just send it out and as I've
sent it to random addresses we don't get
any opens or clicks but here you can
basically see how many opens you got how
many clicks you got and basically track
the performance of different campaigns
that you're sending out so now let's
look at how to create email automation
workflows or sequences here on
activecampaign so before we go ahead and
create our own email automation workflow
I want to quickly show you an example to
make you understand exactly how this
works so here is an example of a simple
email automation workflow with the goal
to get your contacts to sign up for a
phone consultation so every automation
starts with a trigger or just something
that will trigger this automation for a
specific contact so in this case this
would be somebody signs up in a form so
submits any form as you can see here
once this takes place then this
automation will begin the first step of
this automation will be an email which
will be sent out to the contact that's
signed up through the form letting them
know that they can set up a phone
consultation so this would be just a
simple email then the automation will
wait for two days as you can see here
the weight block and then after the two
days this automation will check if the
contact has the tag call scheduled
because when the call is scheduled then
the contact will automatically get the
tag call scheduled and the automation
will know that and know exactly which
way the contact should go now should it
just end this automation because the
call is actually scheduled and the goal
of this automation is complete or if the
tag doesn't exist on the contact it
means that this person hasn't scheduled
a call yet so we need to send out a
reminder to schedule the call so then it
just goes to the no so this is kind of
an if and else block here so if the tag
doesn't exist it goes to the no way here
and then the reminder email will be sent
out to this lead to actually go ahead
and schedule the call now after this
email the other automation will will end
as you can see here with this end this
automation block but if you want to you
can just check again if the tag exists
and then send another reminder email so
you can do this basically infinitely but
this is a very simple automation with
the goal to have somebody schedule a
call great so now that we know what
email automations are let's set up our
own email automation workflow so let's
go to automations on the left side menu
and then let's click on create
automation here on the top right then we
can either start from scratch or we can
use a pre-made automation for specific
goals like follow-up automations or
interest tagging automations and upgrade
incentive and Outreach automation so you
can get some inspiration here but we're
just going to start from scratch so I'm
going to click on start from scratch
here click on continue then like I said
before every automation starts with an
event like a 3 trigger so what I'm going
to build here is just a simple welcome
email automation sequence so the
automation will start whenever somebody
signs up to my email list so what I'm
going to use as a trigger is just
subscribes to a list and then we have to
Define what list this context subscribe
to so let's just do Master contact list
here and let's have this only run once
then if you want we can also segment
context entering this automation we're
just going to not do this for now and
click on start and then here we can
choose the first action in this
automation workflow so something that I
like to do is I like to tag people that
come from a specific place so let's say
I have a funnel that is about email
marketing and then I want people to have
the tag email marketing so that I know
that these people are interested in
email marketing and in the future when I
have something to inform them about or
promote then I know who will be
interested in a specific the product
about email marketing so to add the tag
we can just go to contacts and then I'm
going to click on add a tag which is
going to be the first action in this
automation I'm going to add the tag
email marketing which I've already
created here in activecampaign then I'm
going to click save and this is going to
be the first action so all that happens
is people sign up to the list and they
get the tag email marketing obviously
that only makes sense when everybody who
goes to this list is actually interested
in email marketing otherwise the tag
doesn't make sense now the next action
we can just click on the plus icon and
then add the next action in this
automation let's send them an email so
let's click on sending options and then
click on send an email now we can create
this email so we can just type in let's
say welcome email and then we could
start with a template or use a pass
campaign let's just create a new one
here start with a template then let's
use the text only editor click on
continue click on start from scratch
then here I'm just gonna leave the from
name this is okay then let's say welcome
and then let's say where we have been
giving away a checklist here's your
let's say here's what you requested and
then click on continue and then here
obviously you will just want to type the
email give them what they signed up for
and basically welcome them to our list
then let's click on next Once the email
is finished then here review your
campaign once that's done click on
finish and then we can choose to have
this email sent immediately when
somebody signs up to the email list
which makes sense for the welcome email
or you can also use predictive sending
which has like active campaign learns
when people open their emails the most
so it will just predict when would be
the best time to send this email but for
the welcome email I want to send it
immediately so I'm gonna save this here
so now we've set up the beginning of
this email automation sequence with the
welcome email now the beauty about email
automations is that we can send people
down different Avenues depending on how
or if they interact with our email
campaigns so for example what I could do
now is have active campaign check if the
contact actually opened the email within
two days and if the contact didn't then
I can just send them the same email
again with a different subject line or
if they have opened the email within two
days I will just send them the next
email and then the next email and so on
so to do that we could just go to the
plus sign here and then let's go to
conditions and workflow and click on the
wait block and then we could either just
wait for a specific period of time until
the next action will be triggered or in
my case I want to wait until a specific
condition is met so I'm going to click
on this option and then I want to check
if I'm going to go to actions here and
I'm going to click on has opened because
I want to check if the email was opened
I can leave this to any email or you
could just select your specific campaign
but we only have one email so far so any
email is fine and then I'm gonna check
this here and then I'm gonna have this
be checked for two days so after two
days no matter what happens the
automation is just going to continue
after two days then I'm gonna click on
Save now again if the contact doesn't
open the email then the automation will
wait for two days but as soon as the
email is opened the the automation will
continue here with the next block that I
can add now so let's add an if else
block here under conditions and workflow
let's click on if else and then I'm
going to check the same thing again so
I'm going to do actions has opened and
do any email save so now after two days
if the email wasn't opened it will just
continue to this block and then it will
go down to the no um Avenue here because
the email wasn't opened and we're
checking this again with this block if
the email was opened it will go down the
yes road so what are we going to do if
somebody doesn't open the email so we're
just going to click on the plus sign
here then we're going to just go to
sending options send an email and then
we're going to create another email so
let's just do welcome email follow-up
this is just for you your subscribers
are not going to see what you type in
here follow up and then let's just start
with the template and then create the
same email again with a different
subject line or even create a totally
new email so now I've added the second
welcome email which is the follow-up
email for everybody who hasn't opened
the first one which is this here then we
want to check again we want to give them
some time to open any of our first to
welcome emails so we're going to click
on the plus sign again then we're going
to go to conditions and workflow click
on wait then again again choose wait
until specific conditions are met and
I'm going to do the same thing actions
has opened any email and then we're
going to do this for let's say we're
going to give them another let's say
seven days to see and open any of our
two emails and then click on Save then
once the conditions are met or the time
is has run out we're going to go to if
else again and we're going to check if
somebody has opened the email save and
then if isn't the case if no email is
open then I can basically assume that
this person isn't really interested in
what I am sending them or that this was
a fake email ID and I don't want to have
it on my list so if the answer is no I'm
just gonna go to contacts and then I'm
going to click on unsubscribe to remove
this person from my list because I don't
want to have any inactive contacts on my
list it's just going to hurt my
deliverability rates in the long run so
I just remove those people if they're
not active or interested if the answer
is yes then we can just move them back
to the main road here where they get
some follow-up emails giving them more
information and maybe at some point
following up with a promotion of a
product so here what we could do for
people who have opened the email we just
go to the plus sign here then we want to
wait we don't we don't want to send the
next email immediately after Dev open so
we're going to click on sending options
or actually conditions and workflow
click on weight and we're just going to
wait so let's say we're just gonna wait
for one day click on Save and then after
one day we're gonna send the next email
so I'm going to just click on the plus
sign sending options send email and then
we can do the same thing again so we can
add another let's say we can add another
weight block and let's say we wait for
another two days save and then we add
another email here or we segment again
so everybody who has clicked on the link
we're going to give them a specific tag
or whatever you want to do here in this
automation now here as you can see this
the string is not really connecting to
this one so we need to actually add the
people who have who had a bit longer to
open the first email to also get to this
string here where they receive the
follow-up emails so we're going to click
on the plus sign here and then we're
going to click on go to and this way we
can just connect different blocks so go
to and then we're going to go to the
wait for one day so whenever somebody
doesn't open the email right away they
will get to the follow-up email and
whenever they open any email they will
get you this second string where they
will just receive the follow-up emails
so this was just an example and
obviously there's a million other
automations you could build with
activecampaign so whenever you don't
know how to build something I would
highly recommend to just click on this
support icon here on the bottom right
and ask activecampaign to help you out
to build your workflow that you have in
mind because it can be really
overwhelming is especially with
activecampaign because they give you so
many options so once you are finished
with setting up your workflow you want
to also activate it so you want to click
on activate here on the top right to
make sure it actually triggers when
somebody signs up to your email list so
let's now also look at active campaigns
CRM feature called deals this is a very
powerful tool that can help you manage
your sales team and organize your leads
and help you convert those leads into a
customer so on the left side menu let's
click on deals which will take us to the
CRM feature of activecampaign now the
first thing we have to do is create our
sales pipeline which consists of the
different stages where a lead goes
through to become a customer so let's
click on create a pipeline here then
let's give the pipeline a name let's say
I was selling courses so I would just
type in something like Medics media
courses and then group access says here
you can Define who has access to this
Pipeline and if you have your active
campaign users set up then you have the
default currency let's just leave this
at US Dollars then the assignment method
and you can either have the sales member
manually assigned so you can say who has
to let's say follow up with a specific
customer or lead or you can have it
round robin so whatever you want I'm
going to leave it at manually assign
then I'm going to click on ADD and now
we can see the default Pipeline with
three stages the two contact stage the
in contact stage and the follow-up stage
you can also add more stages by just
clicking on ADD stage here on the top
right then choose a color and then let's
say this is a call scheduled click on
ADD and then you have a new stage now
I'm just going to delete this again and
just stick to the three stages that are
here by default now for each stage you
can just add a deal logically the deal
always start cards at the first stage so
the two contact stage which we can just
click on ADD deal then the deal title
let's say this is the course or the
product that somebody's interested in so
let's say this is the basic course and
then we can also assign a deal value so
you can organize your deals and
prioritize your deals based on the value
so I'm gonna let's just say it's one
thousand dollars and then we can also
add a forecast a close date or a
description here and what's important is
to actually add to the contact the lead
here that is already on your list so
let's say this is Simon and then we can
click on ADD deal now this deal is in
the two context stage so the cool thing
here is whenever the person has been
contacted Simon has been contacted we
can move that in the in contact stage
and then once we had to follow up we can
just move that to the follow-up stage
once we've closed the deal or the deal
is one we can just drag this to the one
area here or if the deal is lost we can
drag it here to the Lost area but let's
just put it back to the two contact
which is the first stage now when we are
interacting with our leads we can just
open up the
um the deal here and then we can add
information we can also add tasks so for
example if we need to schedule a call
with somebody we can just click on add
task here then let's just say call task
type is call and then we can add a date
so let's say we have to call this person
by let's say Friday
1623 and save task we can also assign
this task to a specific sales rep who
has to do this task so click on Save
task then we can also add files we can
go to actions and send an email so just
to stay on top of things you can have
everything here in activecampaign and
then you can also see how many days you
have currently until you have to
complete a task you can also by the way
way automate moving these deals to a
specific column to a specific stage by
using automations and when you have a
lot of deals in this Pipeline with a lot
of tasks to complete a nice view is this
view here the task viewer by clicking on
this icon here then you can see all the
overdue tasks all the tasks that need to
be assigned the upcoming tasks the
scheduled tasks always along with the
deal value so you can really prioritize
what you have to do first in order to
optimize for Revenue so I hope this
