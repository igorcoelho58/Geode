 Everyone in sales who I know keeps talking about clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. Clay. And I want to know, does it live up to the hype? Let's find out. Here is some clay that I just purchased from Michael's. Yellow, some green, this oven baked clay. I'm not entirely sure how this is going to help me sell. I guess we'll find out as we begin to make our model here. Of course, I'm actually going to be looking at clay.com, the AI tool that promises to scale personalize outreach with better data enrichment. Let's check out this thing and see if it really is. They must have for sales reps or it is just another chat GPT clone with a pretty wrap around it. Let's go look. Import, build, lead list, and richer leads with over a hundred data providers. We've got a free trial here, so I guess I will just do that. Create your first table in clay. So we have the option to find companies, find people, find local businesses, import from the CSV, import from CRM, use a template, find companies, look likes or a description. All right, so then what we can do is go into, let's say software, employee size, two to 10, 11 to 50, 5200. And then I'll just import to new table. Would you like to add additional enrichment, select all I guess, and I have some kind of wacky looking clay table here, and now I can add an enrichment. Keep non-texting body run settings, only run if, oh my gosh, this is, this is kind of why I put off making this video because I knew I'd heard clay tables and seen these Excel and screenshots and stuff, and I knew it would be way too complicated for me because I'm charismatic, I'm good at, you know, talking the talk, having good conversations with people, selling them shit. When it comes to this tech side of things, I know I'm somewhat limited in my abilities. If I'm gonna be pretending that I'm selling employee benefits or a HR portal or something like that from like RIPLIN, then what I would wanna do is look for a sign that these companies are not having a good time with their current provider or lack of provider. So if I was in that position, I'd probably go to companies and look at their glass door reviews and look for people who are negatively talking about the benefits or the benefits portal or the HR portal or their payroll being slow. Find companies that I know are gonna be facing the problems that RIPLIN can help solve, maybe in reference some of those negative glass door reviews in my reason for reaching out. With that said, that is a very manual process. Well, it'd be great if I could use clay to scrape the glass door pages of these companies that I'm looking to target. That's what I'm gonna try and accomplish now. And if I can find out how to do that, and I can show that clay can use AI to make that faster than me going to each individual company's glass door profile and looking through their reviews, then that is a total win. Play University, shape your line and clay 101. Okay, I should probably should have watched this first. I'm reading this correctly. I can set up a table that has a list of people who were, you know, ICP FETs, company size industry correct. And then I can add extra filters to find companies that meet a certain criteria using AI that can find anything that's available online. Let's add a column, use AI to look for companies that have negative employee reviews, mention, company, has bad HR processes or systems help me. Generate the prompt. Actors of corporate review analysts focusing on HR process, your task is to identify companies with negative employee reviews, search glass door and indeed, this is amazing. If it can do this, actually show me results of companies that have negative reviews on glass door, then I've saved so much time because then I could reach out to one of those companies who has what there's negative reviews and say, hey, I spotted on glass door that looks like your employees are having some trouble using your HR system to check their paystabs or submit the benefits. I've heard that this can lead to higher employee turnover or even HR having to get involved more than they would like. A lot of smaller stops are using, maybe go to RIPPling because we manage everything all in one place and it's super easy to use platform for both your employees and your HR team. So you've checked out in the past, that could be the email. That research to go on each individual company's glass door page would take me hours. If I can use AI to do that and if it's good, I'm gonna find out in a second, then that will be game changing. Stick a look, except prompt. HR complaints, okay. Good stuff, let's see what happens. Is this gonna work? And how long will it take? So from that search, no companies were found. Some reviews mentioned bad HR and negative manager experience they lack. The specific details requested. Some mentioned bad HR. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna pretend I'm a social media manager. I'm gonna add a column and I'm gonna use AI. Look up, if these companies aren't making new spots, Instagram, TikTok, you do. Include how often they are posting on average. Accept the prompt and we've got 140 credits left. So we'll just run this because that's the point of these review episodes. So I'll see if I should pay for this after I've reviewed it properly. I'm not, okay. How do I, I'm imagining that what I could do, add a new column, there's how many times they're posting on Instagram, how many times they're posting on TikTok, how many posts on YouTube, but I don't know how. I know it must be possible. Well from the future here, you can do this, it's actually super easy. I just didn't know how. The easiest way to do this when you're making the quote is actually, so let's say add a new column, use AI. And then when you add in your prompt, identify, turn over for past year, generate the prompt. Then when you define the outputs, what you can do is add several outputs, negative, turn over. Then it'll be yes, no, and then add an output. You can put a like percentage turn over. It's ultimately gonna peel those out. That's the easiest way to do that. So while you're generating the prompt, input and create new columns for you, if you make the same mistake I did and do the analysis, then what you can do is your text, can rename, comment, column to wherever you want, edit column, click this little spanner button here, and then formula. You can use AI to build formula for you. So you click generate formula, it'll build the formula for you. You can check to make sure it's looking correct, output is correct, save formula, what you get is immediately true false. Now this will then help you create a secondary list of all the companies who have negative comments that you can then buzz through. It comes time to actually start calling these companies. It's not enough to know something about the company. You want to know something about the people and who the right person is. So then you can click find people at this company and then you can look for the people with the right titles at those companies and you can even do further analysis looking for it that you know, joining podcasts if they're posting on LinkedIn themselves, how long they've been in the company, what they're title is, and then you could import those into a sales location platform and even use AI to write the first sentence of a snippet, you know, trigger template back to will from the past year while I check out a couple of things in the tool. And if I was a social media manager or a social media marketing agency, I could use that as a reason to reach out to them because they're not posting or they are posting or they're not posting enough or they're posting tons and not seeing much engagement. The possibilities are potentially endless. Oh, I've got an idea. Let's say I sell toast and I'm looking for businesses and my territory is Halifax and Nova Scotia Canada. It's not very big territory. I got the show end of the store there. That's why I'm behind on Quoters. Definitely not anything I'm doing. Create a new table. Find local businesses with Google Maps. Coffee, shops in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and immediately create a list of these cafes based in Halifax Nova Scotia. Look through it. Google reviews completely. Don't take credit cards. But I like the fact that you use AI to help you build these. So because that means I don't need to go ahead and do all this stuff, right? Review platform, GELP, Review Day, October, reviewer name, and B. And specifically mention the business not accepting credit cards. We've pointed out the inconvenience to payment methods not being as I wish this closely aligned through a crossword payment related to that. Ah, okay. But there must be a way to make sure that I can immediately see that. But that's kind of amazing that it just did that for me. And I could leave that running, build a list of, let's just say, 100 companies who have negative reviews and mentioning payment issues. And then call call all of them as a rapid toast and sell the shit out of toast so they can get a better payments provider so they can piss off fewer customers and can take more payments and be a more successful business. Boom, clay, AI is cool. I like this. Cool stuff. Let's see how much it costs. Because if this is expensive, maybe not starter through individuals. 2000 credits a month. It's $150. Phew. Worth it, in my opinion, worth it. The 149 I think is about what I pay for sales navigator a month anyway. It has the potential to make LinkedIn sales navigator and many other companies, absolutely. If you could also consolidate your data intelligence tools, like as we've been following or Apollo or whatever with this as well, you're gonna be saving money. The only limitation of this tool is the fact that it's fucking complex and scary to look at, which is exactly why procrastinated on making this video for so long. And I'm glad I finally did it. Because frankly, this is dope. This opens up so much more potential for personalization, smartness building. Make sure you're talking to the right people and I would say that's probably the biggest pain point sales people have today is that it takes ages to build lists, to create stuff. It's just, it's pretty darn cool. Let me know if you're already a clay user and if I'm an idiot and thinks that I really possible this because I feel like I've missed a bunch. I'm excited to try more. Peace, love, sales, etching.
