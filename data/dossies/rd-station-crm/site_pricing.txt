FAQ
Is there a minimum contract period?
The contract period depends on the chosen plan. The Light and Basic plans have no minimum contract period. The Pro and Enterprise plans have a minimum contract period of 12 months, after which the plan may be extended indefinitely. The 12-month period was determined based on the experience of our customers: when committed to a full year, they tend to be more successful in the long term. Since we are committed to your success, the minimum contract period is necessary. In the Pro and Enterprise plans, if you cancel the contract within the first year, please note that a cancellation fee applies.
As these plans are designed for bigger companies and contain more advanced features, our implementation package is designed to help your company start using the tool with a focus on your main goal right from the beginning. The implementation period covers initial setup of the platform, integrations with other systems, establishing a strategy, use of available features, etc. Thus, you and your team will be capable of using the tool to its full potential to generate results and achieve a greater return on investment.
How does the implementation period for Pro and Enterprise plans work? How long does it take? What can I expect by the end of it?
One of our consultants will give you technical and strategic support in accordance with the best practices in your market segment. Meetings will occur online and are prescheduled. The total length of the implementation is 4 weeks.
Following the implementation phase, you'll be able to use RD Station Marketing's main features with ease, giving you the confidence to plan, execute and track the results of your company's Digital Marketing campaigns. Note: The project's success is a direct result of how much time you spend carrying out the activities recommended by your consultant.
How is the cost of implementation calculated for Pro and Enterprise plans?
We know that not all companies have the same needs. Therefore, the price is calculated depending on the plan subscription, project complexity, number of consulting hours required and level of expertise of the implementation consultant assigned to you.
Who will be my implementation consultant? Will the implementation consultant create my campaigns?
In the Pro and Enterprise plans, your implementation consultant is an RD Station Marketing expert who also specializes in implementing digital marketing projects for various industries and has been trained by RD Station to help you achieve the results you're looking for.
Please note that RD Station will not perform any operational activities, such as configuring settings, creating Landing Pages or producing content. The role of our consultants is to help you make the most out of the tool.
Will I have any other support in addition to the help of a consultant?
In the Pro and Enterprise plans, your consultant will provide you with strategic support and you will also be able to contact our support team if you have any questions. All our plans include access to our Help Center to help you troubleshoot any potential technical problems. If you have any questions, you can also send an email to our support team.
How much time do I need to dedicate to using the tool?
It depends on your chosen plan, as some contain more features than others. We recommend you spend at least 10 hours per week (2 hours per day) using the tool. However, it's important to remember that your results are directly proportional to your commitment to the project.
Can I add users to my account?
Yes. You can add up to 3 users in the Light plan, 7 users in the Basic plan, 15 users in the Pro plan, and unlimited users in the Enterprise plan.
How can I upgrade my plan?
Upgrading from the Light to the Basic plan is easy and you can do it yourself in the tool. To switch from the Light or Basic plans to a Premium plan (Pro or Enterprise), you will need to contact one of our sales consultants. If you want to upgrade from the Pro to the Enterprise plan, just talk to your account manager.
What are the accepted methods of payment?
RD Station Marketing subscription fees can be paid in Brazilian reais (BRL) by international credit card. All transactions are secure.
What are Leads/Contacts?
A Contact (or Lead) is basically any person included in your RD Station Marketing database. A contact is identified by their email address and other information they provide when filling out a form on your website or when you import an email list into RD Station Marketing.
What happens if I exceed the maximum number of leads/contacts allowed in my plan?
As the size of your RD Station Marketing lead base increases, the change in price and number of contacts on your next bill will be made automatically, according to the predefined levels shown in the table on this page. Don't worry, you won't be caught by surprise: RD Station Marketing sends you an alert whenever you exceed the maximum number of contacts included in your initial subscription. This way, you'll always stay up to date.
How does the free trial work?
You can trial RD Station Marketing for 10 days, during which you will not be charged any fee. We do not require you to register a credit card and we do not charge automatically following the end of the trial period. If, at the end of the trial period, you would like to subscribe to RD Station Marketing, you can do so in two ways, depending on the plan: for Light and Basic plans, you can subscribe online, and for Pro and Enterprise plans you can subscribe by talking with one of our sales consultants, who will help you choose the perfect plan for your business.
What if I have any questions while using RD Station Marketing?
Don't worry! You can always count on our support team to answer any questions you may have within 24 hours, regardless of the plan you subscribe to. You can also search our Help Center to find the answers to your questions or learn more by reading the RD Station Marketing blog. In the Pro and Enterprise plans, you can always count on your Account Manager to answer any questions you may have.
