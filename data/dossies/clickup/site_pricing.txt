Super Fair Billing policy
When we optimize, you save $
When our teams save on AI costs, we pass them onto you. When sudden increases in AI costs occur, we subsidize the cost. If AI providers raise rates, we'll adjust pricing gradually and transparently, while continuing to optimize wherever possible.
