 Click up has long been a favorite tool in the project management space, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you're feeling overwhelmed by ClickUp's complexity, you want a more functional tool that suited to your business or you're just simply exploring the alternatives then stick around because this video is for you. Hi there, I'm Alex Knowles from AutomationHelpers.com and we hold companies like yours, get set up and automated using industry leading portals, apps and integrations. In this video, we're going to explore alternatives to ClickUp looking at their strengths, weaknesses and who their best suited for. So if you've been using ClickUp and you're frustrated with the steep learning curve, you feel it's too chaotic, you think there might be a better tool suited to your business or you're sick of paying the high prices for ClickUp add-ons, stick around because by the end of this video you have a clear understanding which platform is best suited to your needs. ClickUp is a popular project management tool that markets itself as an all-in-one solution targeting a wide range of industries. However, some critics argue that its extensive feature set can lead to complexity and a less cost effective solution. So let's look at what other options are available. Something that we use internally at AutomationHelpers is SmartSuite. SmartSuite offers a robust solution designed to solve issues for businesses. It enables users to manage diverse workflows across various departments such as sales, HR, marketing and operations. Its versatility allows businesses to handle tasks from those that are simple to those that are complex. I'll give you a quick sneak peek into how we are using SmartSuite internally at AutomationHelpers as well as discuss the automations and features we have set up that streamline our processes. Now in each department tasks are usually conducted in a series of steps. Here we've got an idea section planning and research stage, production stage or section editing, publishing and reporting. Here we actually lean on SmartSuite's automations to automate a lot of the manual tasks. If we jump into the solution automation up the top here, and we'll notice that we've got some simple ones like auto setting, assign, record type, etc. But the exciting ones are here within the generate brief and script as well as the Google folders. Now we're managing content. Therefore we have files and these files are stored in our Google Drive. Whenever a video moves to a particular stage, an automated action happens directly within SmartSuite. Here we're actually leaning on AI to do deep research on our behalf on our video topic. Then generate a brief and script for us to dive straight into and begin editing. But enough of that. Another great thing with SmartSuite is the Dashboards view. Here you're able to create a tailored workspace for your department or particular team members so they can quickly and effectively get their work done. Here we'll notice we have multiple views of the same table. We're looking at the planning and research stage, production and so on. Beyond the content pipeline or calendar, SmartSuite is great for managing projects and tasks. We'll notice here the marketing team looks after the initiatives, objectives as well as reporting, leaning on Dashboards and Chart Views to be able to really look at the data. But we're also able to use SmartSuite as a CRM, a sales pipeline. The possibilities are pretty endless. Now while SmartSuite is feature rich, this could lead to a slight learning curve for your team. However, the intuitive design of SmartSuite minimizes this learning phase plus there are plenty of help resources and documents to help your team learn all about the platform. Make sure to check out our SmartSuite playlist to learn plenty more. Next up we're going to look at another tool that is our bread and butter at Automation Helpers AirTable. AirTable is known for its database capabilities. It's a favorite for teams that thrive on structured data. If you're looking to better organize and manage your data in a powerful way, AirTable is a strong contender. It combines the simplicity of spreadsheets with the power of databases, making it ideal for organizing and managing your data. It also shines in native automations and integrations. Now AirTable seamlessly integrates with popular tools like Slack, Salesforce and Google, enabling automated workflows and reducing your team's manual work. Unlike with ClickUp, it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg to set these up either. Now for businesses handling larger data sets or needing more structured workflows, AirTable definitely scales better than ClickUp and perhaps better than any other tool out there. It's ideal for managing detailed projects, tracking inventory or working with complex data sets that feel clunky or somewhat chaotic in ClickUp's UI. AirTable is ideal for teams that need a structured data management solution. Plus the native automations and integrations give you a lot of power to set your manual tasks on autopilot, saving your team time and removing any delays. Next, I want to quickly mention Notion. Now yes, it serves a different purpose to ClickUp, but perhaps that's what you are after. Notion is a great tool for startups or small businesses looking to begin their project management or for those of you that want a document editor that far exceeds the capability of ClickUp's. Notion serves as a unified workspace where teams can write, plan and collaborate. Its flexibility allows for the creation of customized workspaces or dashboards, allowing businesses to build a more tailored work solution. I love Notion, but the versatility can become a double edge sword. If you're managing complex large data sets, well it's going to quickly become chaotic and those complex workflows just simply can't be handled by Notion. For those businesses that want to build a tailored workspace or work solution, the Notion could be a great option which leads us into Coda, a similar tool to Notion, but with more power. Coda is a powerful alternative to ClickUp for teams that need a balance between a structured project management tool and flexible documentation. Now unlike ClickUp's rigid project structure, Coda lets you create fully custom workspaces, blending documents, tables and real-time collaboration. Plus in Coda, the native automations are super powerful and the integrations labelled as Pax can do a lot more than what Notion can do and even ClickUp. ClickUp, however similarly to ClickUp, you'll be paying for those extra packs, as we can see here connecting to Slack, well unless it's included in your pricing plan, you're going to be paying $5 per month just to access that integration. Now the way that Coda is set up is very different to the way air table, smart, sweet, Monday and the usual project management platforms actually run. Because it's a balance between document editing and spreadsheet or databases, well it may be a learning curve for your team to get used to. However that being said, Coda is a great option for businesses that need a functional tool that can also be a tailored and customised workspace. And finally let's take a look at Asana, which is a great tool for those who are just being introduced to digital work management. Asana is renowned for its intuitive interface. Its simple and minimalistic design makes project management easy. It's a straightforward project management tool with straightforward project management features. Asana does offer some simple native automations and integrations that can enable some of your tedious manual tasks to go on autopilot. However when it comes to complex functionality, well Asana just simply can't compete with tools like air table or smart sweet. Asana's main focus is on task and project management, allowing you to create tasks, set deadlines, assign responsibilities and ensure accountability and collaboration. You can customise your work flows through projects that fit specific team processes and there is some flexibility in how much you can organise and customise this. Now while Asana does excel in usability, its functionality is lacking. However something we should mention is in the attractive pricing plan. The starter plan which gives you everything except advanced reporting. Well that's just $11 USD per person. Compare this to ClickUp's quite expensive pricing plan as well as when you start using ClickUp apps or ClickUp add-ons. It starts to become quite pricey. What do you have it? The alternatives to ClickUp. Hopefully this video has provided you with enough info for you to go away and decide which platform is the right for your business.
