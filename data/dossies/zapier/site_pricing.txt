Frequently asked questions
Zapier overview
Do I need to know how to code?
Nope! Zapier makes it easy for you to move data between your apps without being a developer. We may need you to locate information for certain accounts, but we'll guide you through any additional steps. Our Support champions are also here to help you via email should you need assistance.
What are apps?
An app is a web service or application, such as
Google Docs
,
Slack
, or
Salesforce
. Zapier offers integrations for more than 8,000 apps and helps you easily move data between them to automate repetitive tasks.
Premium apps
are select apps exclusively available to users on paid Zapier plans.
What is a Zap?
A Zap is an automated workflow that connects your apps and services together. Each Zap consists of a trigger and one or more actions. When you turn your Zap on, it will run the action steps every time the trigger event occurs.
What are tasks?
A task is counted every time a Zap successfully moves data or completes an action for you automatically. For example, if your Zap has an action to create new Google Contacts, each contact created will use one task. If the action isn't successfully completed, it doesn't count against your task limit.
What is a trigger?
A trigger is an event that starts a Zap. Once you turn on a Zap, Zapier will monitor for that trigger event. For example, if you create a Zap that sends a message to a rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is a new lead entering your lead management app. Triggers don't count toward your task limit.
What's the difference between Zaps, triggers, actions, and tasks?
Zap is our term for the automated workflows you set up to connect your apps. A trigger is the event that starts your Zap. Actions are events that happen automatically after your Zap is triggered. For example, in a Zap that sends a message to a Sales rep each time you get a new lead, the trigger is the new lead entering your lead management app, and the action is the Slack notification sent with the new lead's info.
When Zapier performs an action successfully, it counts as a task. Each successful action in a Zap counts as a separate task.
Does checking (or polling) for new data use tasks?
Zapier never charges you a task to check for new data—only when a Zap successfully completes an action for you.
For instance, say you want an automated workflow to check—or poll—your Dropbox account every five minutes for new files. Then, if a new file appears, the workflow will send you a Slack message. In this case, sending the Slack message about the new Dropbox file counts as a task.
How many tasks do I need?
The number of tasks you need depends on the number of active Zaps you have and how frequently those Zaps run to automate your work. The more actions your Zaps complete, the more tasks you'll need.
But don't worry! When you reach your plan’s task limit, we'll notify you via email. When you reach your plan’s task limit, we'll also switch you to
pay-per-task billing
.
What happens if I hit my task limit?
We'll email you when you reach your plan's task limit. Once you've reached that limit, we'll switch you to pay-per-task billing at a rate of 1.25x the cost of a base task on your subscription so your Zaps continue running.
When you're on pay-per-task billing, we’ll email you if you’re close to your plan’s maximum task limit (3x your task subscription) and then again when you reach it. Once you’ve reached your maximum task limit, your Zaps will pause until the start of your next pay period.
You can

. Our
Sales team
is also available to help you choose the right plan for your business.
Will I be charged a task for any of Zapier’s built-in data tools?
Zapier offers a variety of
built-in data tools in the App Directory
that help you add conditional filter and path logic, and format data. The following steps don't count as a task:

Formatter by Zapier
Path by Zapier
Delay, Looping, Sub-Zap, Digest, Zapier Manager, Storage
How many connections does Zapier support?

developer platform
.
Tables

How is Tables different from other options out there?

Interfaces

How is Interfaces different from other options out there?

Frequently asked questions
What is an activity?
Activities include actions your agent takes in behaviors or in chat, browsing the web, or looking up information from attached knowledge. For a complete description,
see this article
. You can run up to 400 activities per month on a Free plan, or up to 1,500 on a Pro plan.
If you need more activities, let's talk
.
How are activities counted for Zapier Team accounts?
If you have a Team account on Zapier, your team shares a pool of Agents activities. For example, if you upgrade to a Pro plan for Agents, you can run up to 1,500 activities across all the agents your team creates.
Can I use Agents with my Zapier Enterprise account?
Not out of the box. Zapier Agents doesn't currently support app and action restrictions that may be in place on an Enterprise account. If you’re on an Enterprise plan and would like to use Agents, please
reach out to us
.
How do I improve the reliability of agents?
You can improve your agent's reliability by following a few of our tips for writing an effective AI prompt:
Include helpful info up front
Provide examples
Define the expected format and length of your response
Give bots a role
Browse our prompt tips.
Why don’t I get the same outcome from AI every time?
That’s because of non-determinism. That’s the fancy term describing why AI agents will reply with different, but likely similar, answers to the same question. It’s a feature that’s core to Large Language Models (LLMs), and what makes LLMs different from computers, which will do the same thing every single time. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
What app actions can agents perform on my behalf?
Zapier Agents can only take actions in the apps you’ve connected and use the triggers and actions you’ve set up. When configuring a behavior trigger or action field for an agent, you can have it always use the same value, pick from a specific set of values, have it guess the value, or not set any value. To provide additional control, you can add more details to your behavior instructions.
For example, if you want your agent to always send a direct message to you in Slack, select yourself in the "To username" field but leave the "Message" field "Let your agent generate a value for this field" so your agent can send a custom message every time.
How can I get access to Agents?
