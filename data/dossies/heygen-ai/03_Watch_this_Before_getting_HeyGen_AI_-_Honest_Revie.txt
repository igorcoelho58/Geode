 Watch this before getting Hagen AI. Today I want to give my honest review on this tool and maybe talk about some comparisons and also pros and cons of things I like and things I don't like. And again, I'm just a normal person that's been testing this tool and it's competitors. And today I want to shed some light and I'm just going to jump into the tool and show you some things that I do like and what I don't like. So first of all, this tool is crazy. Like if you're looking to make AI avatar videos, it's insane. First, I want to show you some quick examples of some crazy videos that you can just throw together within seconds. Like this is an AI avatar that Hagen supplied me and I just put it on a video with a custom background. Have a listen. Buying your first home can be scary, but here's how to save thousands first, shop around the video. The video is okay, right? And a lot of times what I tell people to do is some of these AI voices so that one of the biggest setbacks to using these AI avatars is the voices, right? What I always tell people to do is download your video and then throw it into a video editor and speed it up just a tiny little bit. And then also cut the time gaps, like put splits in there where it's in between sentences because AI voices really, really struggle with that. And if you're looking to make these look a little more realistic, that's what we do here. And again, I own a little media company and I help small businesses create content. And this is huge for small businesses because they don't have to pay influencers. And it's huge, right? So what you can do is use their AI avatars and there's a bunch of them. You can choose different layouts. You can choose, there's like a hundred of them. And it's crazy how many settings you can change. This is a boring insurance video that we made. Have a listen to this one. See what you think. Let's talk about policy genius, the online insurance marketplace that promises to make getting life insurance. So it's okay, right? And a lot of times what you need to do, again, throw some video editing in there. Because if you just upload this the way it is, it's not going to do the greatest. Okay, so and then what you can do, one, I'm going to show you my avatar that I made of myself. And then what we're also going to do is talk about the comparison of some of the competitors in pricing because it's crucial to know this because the pricing kind of makes and breaks a lot of these like competitors. And it kind of boils down to the amount of videos we can make. All right, so here is a real I made of myself. Obviously it's the same picture in the background as you can see in this video. Let's have a listen. Want to make money online, but don't know where to start? Let me save you some time. The best way right now is a film. Okay, so the voice is really good. Like you can't even tell the difference. The voice is probably the biggest distinguishing factor. And what a lot of people are saying is that if you actually go into the editing of the video, hey, Jen's like biggest setback is the voiceovers, right? And they just integrated this. You can actually use 11 labs to integrate in here. So you can choose, all you do is choose your profile once you go there, but what you have to do, it's kind of stupid, but you have to go over to 11 labs, create an account, get a subscription over there because they're the specialty voice, AI voices. You know, like they kind of own that scene whereas hey, Jen is the specialty AI avatars. So you got to mix the two. It doesn't make sense really. I feel like hey, Jen should team up with them a little more and have a subscription together, but what do I know? You don't even mean, I don't know the logistics of business, but that is one of the biggest setbacks is the voices, but and again, you can choose different voices. All right, so what's really crucial to know about hey, Jen, again, this is just my honest review, is to look at the competitors and what I've done is have actually compared all of them. We've been using all of them. So there's three that kind of lead the scene. We have hey, Jen, AI, we have create a fire, and then we have Synthesia. And in my honest opinion, Synthesia is actually the best. So if you're looking for like super high quality, non-distinguishable AI, they have the best AI avatars, but there's a catch. It's the pricing. So Synthesia, if we boil down the pricing and a lot of these have very competitive pricing as far as like the same price is. Like Synthesia is the same price as hey, Jen, and create a fire is a little bit more. So Synthesia, the biggest setback is you only get 10 minutes of video a month for the $29 plan. 10 minutes, like that's nothing, bro. And then the creator plan is 30 minutes of video a month, which it has the highest quality videos, but like they're priced way out of like our league. And then createifies the next best one. That's a credit system, which I feel like it's kind of annoying when it comes to videos. It's saying you get 100 credits or around 20 videos a month for the $39 a month. And then the $99 a month is around 200 credits in 40 videos. But there's a red flag here, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, let's look at hey Jen's pricing, right? So hey Jen, actually with their creator plan, you get unlimited videos. So like this is a no-brainer guys. And if you're looking to like sign up for one of these, hey Jen is probably the best. And again, guys, hate to do this, but consider signing up using my affiliate link in the description helping out a brother here. I just get a small percentage of that. And you know, like I'm just trying to shed some light on helping other people because we've been using these tools. And like again, the secret sauce guys is really just dialing down training the module. It kind of depends what you're trying to do. Like if you're creating your own avatar and you want to like replicate yourself, my I really suggest training the model with like a really extensive video. I only gave it a 40 second reel to learn off of. And you can kind of tell it's just not the greatest. I mean, it works. Don't get me wrong. And again, you can change the backgrounds in here. This is what the video editor looks like. You can legit put any background up here. You can do captions. All you do is paste your script and you click generate, your videos made. And you get unlimited videos. So like I feel like this is the best option if you're looking to do AI avatars. And as far as like creating all the, to make these videos look more realistic, train the modules best as you can. And then if you're looking to make like use other avatars, my suggestion is to find specific avatars that look good and have the same kind of feel and throw these videos into a video editor and speed them up just a tiny bit and add a lot of editing. You know, like I could go into video editor and show you how to do this, but I feel like I would borrow the heck out of you guys. So this is my honest review. Watch this video before getting Hage and AI. Consider using my affiliate links in the description. I link to all of them too. So if you want to check them out, the pricing on Hage and is like hands down the best though it seems because you get unlimited videos. Synthesia does have the best avatars and technology it feels like, but you only get 10 minutes a month. Creatify is actually really good too. Creatify is like my next favorite. Here's some examples on creative life. Want to make money online, but don't know where to start. Let me save you some time. The best way right now. And again, what you can do is kind of mess around with some of these videos because sometimes the AI voice feels a little stale. Like this guy's a little stale. And what I do is I put it into a video editor and I start messing with the voice settings. You know, a lot of these editors have like studio settings, like Descript Has it. So have a listen again. Want to make money online, but don't know where to start. Let me save you some time. The best way right now. Because a lot of times if you can add like that studio effect, because you know like Adobe Has it, Descript Has it, CapCut Has it. It's essentially like an audio enhancer. And it really kind of helps make these videos a lot better. And it just sounds like more of like a studio feel. Because the AI voices are really kind of stale. It sounds like they're in like this wooden box of a room. Hopefully that makes sense. So guys, hit me up in the comments. I'm below, what are you looking to do? I'm just a normal video geek that kind of like is trying to stay up to date on using all these AI tools to help my clients, small businesses, and myself. And my brands create content more easily. Because how can you not? It's crazy, right? The tech that's out. All the links will be in the description. I have courses, just all that crap. Watch this before getting Hey Jen. This is my honest review. All right guys, later.
