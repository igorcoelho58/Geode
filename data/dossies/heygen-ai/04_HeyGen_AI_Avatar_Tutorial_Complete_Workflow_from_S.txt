 Hey there! Welcome to my AI Automation Channel on YouTube. Like today I'm excited to show you step by step how to create stunning AI-generated videos just like this one using a combination of three powerful platforms. Hey Gen for hyper-realistic avatars, 11 labs for training your AI voice clone and make.com to automate the entire video creation process. I'll guide you step by step on how to utilize Hey Gen to design your hyper-realistic AI avatar, harness the capabilities of 11 labs for voice cloning, and seamlessly integrate these with make.com to automate your workflow. By the end of this tutorial you'll have all the tools you need to create professional AI-driven videos effortlessly. Please subscribe to the channel and feel free to join my school community. All the links are in the description below and without further ado let's get started right now. Hey there and welcome to this complete course showing how to create AI avatar videos using a powerful platform called Hagen. So I've got the website pulled up here. This is what we're going to be using to create the avatar videos in this course and as you can see this is what it looks like. You can create your own avatar based on your videos that you will upload to Hagen and you can also create an AI voice clone using this platform as well. So pretty much all you have to do is feed it a script and it will speak the words which is amazing. So you're going to want to get started with Hey Gen. It's completely free to start and then they also offer paid plans as well. If you come over to pricing here you can check out the different pricing plans and I've actually got Creator plan which is 29 per month and that allows you to create unlimited videos up to 30 minutes, 1080p, fast video processing and then you can do a lot of other things as well including voice cloning which I'll show you how to use setup in Hagen and then also in 11 labs as well which is a separate platform for creating professional voice clones. So if you're excited to learn more about how to use Hagen to create your own AI avatar videos like I'm already doing on my YouTube channel and then also in the school community then this is the course for you. With that being said let's get started I'll see you in the next module. Come back. So once you've created your free account on Hagen you're obviously going to want to log in so I'm just going to sign in real quick and then it will put me into my dashboard. So this is what you see when you first log in to Hagen anytime you log in to Hagen and you have a couple different options here. You can turn a photo into a video with avatar 4 so basically you just upload a photo, give it a script and it will create an entire video for you which I'm currently already doing so we'll see what that looks like a little bit later. You can also join the video agent wait list so this is another new thing that they're coming out with. It's the creative OS so if you want to join that you can join and then get access when it's available. You've got another thing here for quick avatar videos which I haven't used yet but basically you can choose from many custom pre-designed avatars here and then just create your own tech talking avatar using the script. You can also translate videos so that's another really powerful thing about Hagen is that you can talk in any language basically. You can do audio dubbing, you can do translations and basically you can create videos up to 30 minutes on the creator plan so if I want to drop in a video and translate it into another language I can do that from here as well. You can also create your own avatar so in this case I'm on the creator plan and we'll need to upgrade to a different plan to create more avatar videos and there's a couple other things in here you can do as well. You can also see some of your recent creations so as you can see here I've got some creations that I've already made and if I want to watch that I can just click here and watch the video from directly within Hagen. So I can do that from here. You can also edit the video which I'll show you have to do a little bit later once we've created our own first avatar video. Welcome back in this step we're going to be actually training our AI avatar video so as you can see I already have my AI mic clone right here so if I click on it you can see what this looks like. It's hyper realistic it looks almost exactly like me and we can just scrub through and you can see kind of what the video looks like here and you can also add gestures so if I want to make a pointing gesture I can do that I can edit the look as well and in order to show you how to create one of these AI avatars I actually need to delete this one because I can only create one at a time on the creator plan otherwise I need to upgrade to get more avatar slots and I actually want to improve this one a little bit anyway so I'm just going to delete this and as you can see I only have two more avatar replacements this month which is fine so I'm just going to delete this avatar and I want to improve a few things on it so I'm just going to click on start with it will play you a little demo video right here and now you can read through the footage instructions so you need to make sure to use the right equipment and like I say submit two to five minutes of unedited video footage with a professional camera so the more video footage that you provide it the better I just have a little two minute clip that I'm going to upload and then you also want to make sure to set the right environment ideally something you know a beautiful backdrop speak naturally and clearly so maintain a steady pace pausing one to two seconds between sentences with lips closed and subtle movement clear expressions so those are the guidelines for the video and now here we can either upload the footage record via webcam or record via a phone in this case I already have the video footage ready to go so I'm just going to come over here and select my sample video so there we are that's the sample video that I'm going to use and as you can see it's about two and a half minutes long and key point here is it's got a very nice backdrop so this is just a beach where I live in Koso Mui and yeah so that's really gets people's attention right and here you can either keep the ambient sounds in the recording or you can remove them I think I'm actually going to keep them and then you can do background removal as well so that allows background changes and removal when using the avatar I might as well keep that selected and then you can also turn on 4k resolution but you will need to upgrade to the team plan in order to do that and I don't really need that because the video is in 1080 so I'm just going to select next and here I'm actually going to have to do this off camera because I need to record the following script and then just give them permission to use my my video so I'm going to do that real quick and then I'll come right back to you okay so now I've finished recording the video it just gives them permission to use your likeness essentially it takes about 10 to 20 seconds to validate the consent and now the consent is validated so I'm going to select next and as you can see it's just going through and checking off everything that's identified in the sample video looks like my camera isn't perfectly stable but it's really not the end of the world and I'm also not looking directly into the camera at certain times as well but overall pretty much everything is a check here well lit environment strung background contrast express the facial movements subtle body movements mouth is visible at all times and at least two minutes of footage like I say you will need at least two minutes of footage and there should only be one person in the forefront which is me and then maintain same position in the frame so those should all come through as check marks and if we want to improve any of those things we can it's going to result in a better a better avatar but for the most part I think this should be good to go hopefully even better than my other avatar and I'm just going to click on submit so now it's going to upload the video it's going to do some processing and as you can see the avatar look is now being created and then you'll get a notification in a couple minutes once it's ready via email and then also over here within agent as well it says avatar video is ready so now we can give it a name I'm just going to call it a i mic so I'm curious to see what it looks like looks great and also now there's some movement in the background as well which is kind of what I was hoping for so it looks even more real and my my head is just staying looking at the camera most of the time so that's exactly what I want and now in the next video I'm going to show you how to actually create a video with a script in the AI studio you can use either landscape or portrait book but first before we create the AI avatar video we need to give it a voice so in order to do that we'll come over to AI voice which is right below avatars and now we've got a couple different options to choose from we can either use the voice capabilities that are built into hajan or we can connect up a third party application which is called 11 labs in order to provide it a professional voice clone so it's entirely up to you how you want to do this for most cases hajan is going to be good enough but if you want a professional voice clone which is trained on up to 30 minutes of audio I recommend using 11 labs I'll show you how to do both of those both of these in this video in this course I should say so if you want to use hajan you can use instant voice cloning right here and then all you have to do is upload an audio file like it's only has to be two minutes long just training it on your voice and then you can create a voice clone within hajan so that's an option and I think I have one here already so if I go down to void it looks like I may have already deleted them unfortunately but as you can see I've got a professional voice clone right here which is actually coming from 11 labs so that one sounds almost exactly like me and then I've also got the voice clone here which I believe is from within hajan or maybe it's 11 labs but yeah if you want to create your own voice clone in hajan you can just do that here and like I say you only need to upload two minutes of audio you just simply upload it and then you can create your own voice clone within hajan or you can use 11 labs which I'll show you how to connect up and get started with in the next video module in this part of the course I'm going to show you how to get started with 11 labs to create your own voice clone which you can then connect up to hajan using the API so first of all you're going to want to come over to 11 labs the website and as you can see it's the most realistic voice AI platform AI voice models and products powering millions of developers creators and enterprises so you can read through this website and just learn a little bit more about how 11 labs works you can create voice overs dubbed videos podcasts voice cloning text to speech it can do a lot of different things you can also translate your content like drew benski here is doing into different languages so it's pretty powerful let's say I wanted to create a video in english and translate it into tie for example um you can do that using 11 labs as well it's really amazing what I can do and it's also got conversational AI built into it and voice cloning which is mostly what we're going to be using for in this course so in order to get started they do have different pricing plans of course um the cheapest one is only five dollars per month and I'm actually on the creator plan which allows you to create professional voice clones so these are voices that sound almost indistinguishable from your actual voice and it provides higher quality audio up to $192 kilobits per second so I recommend the creator plan and it's only let's see $11 per month I actually $18 per month unless you do the yearly plan so we're going to get started you're just going to sign up for your free account and then come over to log in here to remember what which email I created the account went so let me just log in real quick okay so now I'm logged into my account and as you can see this is the dashboard you've got a lot of different options here instant speech audio book conversational AI sound effect dub audio all these different things and you can also look through your library or create a clone of your voice so in this case we want to click on clone your voice and from here you can add a new voice so as you can see on my plan I've got access to all of them except for the professional voice clone because I've I've only got one slot available so as you can see voice limit of one reached I need to upgrade to the business tier to unlock two additional slots but that's fine because I don't need another professional voice clone I've already got one and if you want to train it on the instant voice clone it only needs I think like 10 seconds of audio so it's fairly limited in terms of what you can do with the instant voice clone but for most cases it's going to be good enough but if you want a professional voice clone I do recommend upgrading to the creator plan I'll leave a link below where you can create your creator plan on 11 labs if you want to do so and as you can see here I've already got my instant which doesn't really sound all that much likely like me and then I've also got the professional voice clone and that one sounds almost identical to my actual voice right so if I want to get the voice ID which I'm going to need later when I show you how to build out the automation we're going to need the voice ID we can do so here and we want but first we want to connect this up within Hagen right so in order to do that we're going to come down to here so click on your profile and then go to API keys right here this is what you need API key so in order to connect it up in Hagen we're going to create a new API key we'll just call it Hagen for the purposes of this example and then we're going to create the API key right here and then you will need to give it access to a couple of these so obviously you need access to the voice let's just use read only and honestly that should be good you might want to turn on text to speech as well if you want those and maybe speech to speech and speech to text and that should be good maybe voice generation as well and then we're just going to click on create right here so there's the API key so you're just going to copy that and you're going to come back over to Hagen here and go to integrate third party voice right here this is where you're going to import your voice so once you've created your voice clone either instant or professional you can import your voice here and then you're just going to select 11 labs and enter your API key and then click on confirm so that will connect up 11 labs and now you can import your voices here so as you can see once API is connected I'm importing my professional voice clone right here you just make sure to turn this on and then it will get access to your voice clone right here so it actually just imported another one here which I don't really need I really am only using the professional voice clone and that's coming from 11 labs right so that's pretty much all there is to it for connecting up 11 labs to Hagen and that will just allow you to create more professional voice clones that sound like I say almost exactly like you and in the next video I'll show you how to combine the avatar with the AI voice clone to create an entire scripted video which you can put up on YouTube and this part is of course I'm going to show you how to create your own AI avatar scripted video using Hagen so I'm already in my projects folder as you can see I've already created a lot of different videos which I'm mostly posting up on my YouTube channel with the AI avatar and if I want to do that I can just call it up to create video right here and then first of all you'll need to select the portrait either portrait or landscape mode in this case I want to create another one for my YouTube channel so I'm just going to select landscape video and that will open up the AI studio video editor now this already has a pre-made avatar right here but I don't want to use that one I want to use my AI avatar that we've already created right so I'm going to replace the avatar and I'm going to put mine in there instead so here we go and you can also create a lot of different looks as well which I haven't really played around with too much I'm just using this one so we'll import that into the video project and we're also going to give it a voice as well so I'm going to select from my voice the professional voice clone that we've already imported from 11 labs or perhaps you're using your Hagen generated voice instead you can select that here and now we're going to input the script so we can either speak into it and then it will generate this it will create the script for you or you can use chat GPT for example to create a script so in this case just as an example I'm going to tell it to create a script for an AI avatar video introducing I'm sorry introducing people to my free school community for example there we go now let's see what it comes up with this is just chat GPT as a sidebar in opera which is the browser that I use in case you're curious who's going to take that and obviously the script you can you can make it whatever you want and also I do recommend not including like scene directions in here as well actually you know in this case I'm just going to come back oh I'm going to come over to make calm and use an automation that I have for creating scripts so this basically just creates scripts using make calm so it's going to I have one to research the topic and create the script I also have one that gets transcripts and create scripts but where's the one that actually creates this script just a basic script yeah I don't see it right off YouTube transcript that's not it so yeah let's not worry about that right now I'm just going to use this as an example and then all you have to do is give it a name example video and then just click generate there we go you can select the resolution and also frames per second which I'm going to use 30 frames per second you can also turn off the watermark if you're on the paid plan which I recommend doing and then MP4 is good for the format and then I'm just going to click submit here so that's going to take a couple minutes and then it will create the avatar video using the script that we've provided I'll show you what it looks like after it's finished we'll be right back okay so now the video is finished if I want to watch it I can simply click on watch right here and we'll see what it looks like you won't be able to actually hear it unfortunately but you can at least see what the video looks like so we're just going to play this right real quick that looks pretty good it definitely looks better than my other AI avatar video so I was able to fix it up a little bit and that's pretty much all there is to it for creating the video and now we can just simply download it by clicking up here or we can also share it to social media that sort of as well if you want to send it to anybody you can do that and you can also get the video ID from here as well which we're going to need a little bit later for the automation so in the next one I'm going to show you how to actually automate this entire process and I'm also going to provide you the template as well so that you can just get the template and put it into make.com so here we are inside make.com if you want to create your free account on make.com I will leave a link down below it's an affiliate link so I'll get a small commission if you sign up always appreciated and then once you're in make.com you can come over down to scenarios and I'll show you what the automation looks like this is for high-level you know people that want to start automating this sort of thing I've already created an automation and there is the template down below so you can basically download the template and import it into make.com all you have to do is come down here and then import a blueprint so you can just import the blueprint and this will put it straight into make.com so this one is a little bit complicated there's more steps in here than you really need if you're just getting started but the most important part here is since we've already you can basically generate the script using chat GPT you can do the research in perplexity and I've also got topics that I'm pulling in from air table as well so basically the different topics that I want to create videos around and then it's using perplexity to do the research so I'm basically just feeding in a topic here and telling it to do research on that topic and then it's generating the script using an assistant that I've set up so it's just telling it to create a five minute video script for YouTube on that specific topic in this case I would actually put like to make sure that it's under three minutes long it can't be longer than three minutes long unless you have like the pro plan of the API so it's a little bit complicated but basically you can only create three minute videos using the automation so in this case I'm just going to put you know a thousand word video script right just to make sure that it's less than three minutes long and then it's using that topic and it's getting the content from perplexity that from the research that it's done right so that's generating the script and then you can connect up Hagen all you have to do is add a module right here and then select Hagen and this is how you create the avatar video right here so just click on create avatar video it'll put in the module and then you obviously have to connect this up using your you can just log in the Hagen right here and then connect it up to make.com and then from there you can just select avatar video you're going to want to input your avatar ID here as well which you can get from Hagen so we're going to come back over to Hagen here and then you click on avatars and then from here you're going to want to select your avatar and you can get the avatar ID right here so you're just going to copy that avatar ID come back over to make.com input it here so that's the specific avatar you want to use you can also just select it turn off mapping and then you can select it from here as well so we'll pull in all of the different avatars and then you can select that one. In this case I'm just going to use the ID you can set the scale as well and then most of this you can just keep the same and then here you're going to want to select voice type as text and you can pull in your voice clone so I'm actually not using the right one I need to select professional voice clone right here and then we can input the result so the script right here we're going to want to feed in the script from that I generate a using chat GPT and you can also set the voice pitch also the I'm going to change this to excited for the voice emotion and title of the video I'm just using the topic that I'm getting from air table turn test mode off and then you can also leave off captions as well and for my API plan I can only create up to 720p videos unfortunately I can't use 1080 so you're going to want to use 720 in most cases and then this right here I'm basically just waiting 300 seconds so that it has time to generate the video I found that it doesn't usually take longer than about 600 seconds to create the video and then over here we're going to give it the video ID so based on creating the avatar video we can feed it in a video ID so that's the specific video that I created and all we're doing there is just getting the video and then here we can get the file so this is the video URL right here I think it's actually this one so this is the video URL that is created in agent so it's just feeding that in it's getting the video and then that's basically downloading the video this is an HTTP request so HTTP request you can get a file right here and you can basically just get that download that file I'm also getting the thumbnail that is generated as well because it does create a thumbnail so I'm dragging in the thumbnail URL it's downloading the thumbnail and then next basically you can upload this to Facebook you can upload it to Instagram you can upload it to YouTube there's all sorts of different modules so if I wanted to upload this to Instagram instead of YouTube I can easily do that here as well and I can just go to Instagram and then I think it would be create a real post right so I can upload the the file there to Instagram but in this case I want to upload this automatically to my YouTube channel so I've got my YouTube channel selected you can give it a title and then you're passing in the file that you've already downloaded so that's the first file that we downloaded and then I'm making it unlisted and then I can I can make it public later and then I'm also making sure to turn on the AI generated label right here so I want to make sure to say that this video was is AI generated so I'm just going to select yes here and that will upload the video to YouTube and then I'm also setting the thumbnail as well so this is going to be the video ID that we're getting so we've already uploaded the video then we're going to drag in the specific video ID from YouTube and we're going to upload the thumbnail so that's the second step right here once we've gotten the thumbnail we can then upload it here you can also map it as well but in this case I'm just going to select this one and then at the last step is we just update the air table we're basically just saying that we're passing it in the URL and then we're marking the status as done right here so if that's too complicated for you I would recommend just downloading the template so that you don't have to set all this up yourself and this is basically just automating the entire process of creating these videos so in the next module I'm going to show you what this looks like when it's running and then also if it actually uploads to YouTube so I'll see you in the next module and make sure to grab that template down below if you want to just import this. On this automation it will do the research and perplexity create the video script using a chat GPT assistant it will create the AI avatar video get the video download the video get the thumbnail upload the video to YouTube set the video thumbnail and then update the record so if everything goes according to plan this should run and automatically upload the video to YouTube so let me just first check my air table so it should have some topics in here I'm just going to click run and there we go so now it's doing the research in perplexity it's just researching the topic it's generating the script using a custom AI assistant that I've set up and then it's going to start creating the AI avatar video based on it's just going to feed the script straight into hagen and then once the video is finished it should upload it to YouTube assuming we don't have any issues here and unfortunately it looks like it was no longer found so that says operation failed with okay so it may be the wrong avatar ID and that makes perfect sense because I've actually created a new avatar if you remember from earlier so I need to get the new avatar ID that's what happened here so I need to get this ID and we're going to come back over to make an input that new avatar ID so now if we run this again it should start generating the AI avatar video correctly this time and then it usually takes about five to six minutes to create the entire video that's why I have this weight loop right here which is basically waiting 600 seconds and then it will get the video uploaded to YouTube so see if it works correctly this time hopefully it doesn't have any rate limits because I have been hitting some some limits but yeah so now it's creating the video seven AI YouTube automation niches to start in 2025 that's coming from my air table which is a that's the topic that I want to create the video on and here's all of the settings that it's passing into haagen right here and now it's just waiting over here so if we come back over to haagen here and go to projects you will see that it should be yep so there it is it's creating the video in haagen and hopefully it doesn't have any issues with the time limit I will come back to you and show you what it looks like once it's finished so yeah unfortunately I was afraid this is going to happen it had an API video processing error so if we see here video is too long 180 greater than 180 seconds so you need to upgrade to the pro plan which is like $99 per month to use and I don't really want to do that so I need to figure out how to make sure that it's less than three minutes long so in order to do that I will need to probably change my script over here my prompt so I'm just going to make it 500 words instead and then I'm going to click run again so that's the one issue that I'm having with haagen is that the API only allows you to create videos up to three minutes long and you can't create anything longer than that unfortunately so I'm just going to remove this one and try this again it's creating the script right now using chat GPT and then it will create another AI avatar video hopefully it will actually work this time we'll see so now it's creating the video if I come back over to haagen and refresh we should see the video being created and we'll see if it works this time and unfortunately it still had an error it says it can't be longer than 180 seconds so this is the you know this is something that you're probably going to have to upgrade to the pro plan and the API pricing is over here so it doesn't actually show the API plans here if we click oh here we go let's go to API so let's go to pricing and then API plans right here so as you can see the pro plan is 99 dollars per month and you can you can still only create one minute of generated AI avatar videos which doesn't really do very much and then the max plan is like $330 a month which is way too expensive for me so I'm just using the free plan and yeah I'm not exactly sure how to how to actually get past that step but you can create the videos still using this script I mean this automation and then you can just feed in the video ID if you want to do it that way but unfortunately it looks like for now I'm not going to be able to use this automation so I just need to create the scripts manually from projects like we did earlier you just click on creative video and then you can create the video from within agent but there are some other things that you can do within make dot com such as creating the scripts so I have another automation to do that so if I just search for script right here it can research a topic and create the video script so this one is basically just using a couple of the modules such as perplexity to research the topic so I can just put in a topic here and then research that topic and then I'm using Clawed to create the script right here so it's creating a 15 word script based on the research and then it's just creating a Google doc from that so I take the script and then I just put it into haagen so that saves me a lot of time to create these videos and then I can just upload them to YouTube manually unfortunately that's the way I have to do it for now at least until haagen opens up their API for longer videos I've already contacted customer support and they've assured me that unfortunately for now I will need to upgrade to the pro plan which I don't really want to do but that shows you how to create these these video scripts create your own AI avatar videos and this basically saves you time and money for your business maybe you're not comfortable on the camera and you just want to create these AI videos that you can put up on YouTube or Facebook or wherever you want I will caution you a little bit because YouTube is starting to crack down on some of these this AI generated content but if you're actually providing value with people I don't think it should really be much of an issue so yeah in the next video I'm just going to wrap things up and show you the next steps and talk a little bit more about my coaching program as well first of all I just wanted to congratulate you on completing this course I think creating AI avatar videos is going to be amazing for your business moving forward you can post on social media you can automate a lot of this stuff and they also have paid plans as well and haagen so I'm on the creator plan you can also get the team plan but yeah for you can create unlimited videos up to 30 minutes 1080p fast processing you can create the AI avatar videos voice cloning within haagen as well as 11 labs it also supports translations as well which we didn't touch on in this course but if you want to make videos in different languages you can also translate the videos as well and do lip syncing in different languages so it's very very powerful and I also wanted to go over a little bit more details about my coaching program inside school as well so this is my six week AI automation coaching program it's for anybody that wants to take their AI automation to the next level to save 20 or more hours per week and grow your business faster so if you don't know already why AI animations are critical for your business they allow you to save time save money improve customer experience and scale without burnout so basically you can just automate a lot of the repetitive tasks that you're doing without adding more you know more people to your team if you can set up an AI agent that will do everything for you 24-7 it doesn't sleep it doesn't make mistakes this is really really powerful for your business so the coaching program is 1399 and that's for six weeks I provide you all the ready to implement AI automations you get all the templates you get the strategy call with me which is 60 minutes and we can go over basically how to some of the things that you may want to start automating
