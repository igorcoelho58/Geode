Our Mission
Everyone has a story.
HeyGen allows you to tell it.
Why we’re building HeyGen. From idea to innovation
HeyGen started with a simple idea—making video creation effortless. Today, we’re transforming storytelling with AI, empowering anyone to create high-quality videos without limits.
We live in a video-first world
Over 1 billion hours of videos are watched daily on YouTube, and the average person watches 17 hours of video each week. So if a business wants customers, it needs videos. And videos need cameras — and actors, locations, editing software, reshoots… between all of that, finished videos can cost $1,000 per minute. At least.
And then AI came along
People love video. But most people hate being on camera. That's what founder Joshua Xu discovered when he was an engineer at Snap, building features for SnapChat Ads and the AI camera. But with AI video generation, everyone can unleash their inner storyteller — removing the camera actually unlocks creativity and freedom in visual storytelling. And so HeyGen was born.
Now you only need a script
With HeyGen, businesses can simply write their script and generate their video. No camera, no budget, no headaches. We've helped over 100,000 companies and millions of people create, localize, and personalize videos at scale — and we're just getting started. As we set industry standards for the ethical use of AI video, and lead the charge towards more immersive AI experiences, we know this is only the beginning. We're excited to see where this story goes.
Built for the best,  backed by the best
HeyGen is proud to be backed by leading investors including Benchmark, Conviction, Thrive Capital, and Bond, who share our vision of transforming storytelling through AI-powered video.
