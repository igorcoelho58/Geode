What happens when I cancel my subscription?
When you cancel your subscription, you are canceling your billing cycle renewal. This means you will still have access to your subscription features until the end of the active billing cycle. However, you will not be charged for any more renewals.
What Is the difference between a monthly & yearly subscription?
The monthly subscription charges your payment method every month, whereas the annual subscription charges it once a year. The actual monthly cost of the annual subscription is less than the monthly subscription.
How do I switch plans?
You can switch your plan in the web application. Upgrades to your plan will take effect immediately. Downgrades will be scheduled to occur at the end of your billing cycle.
Am I allowed to use videos to promote services to clients?
Yes. We donʼt limit how you use or distribute the videos once you make them, as long as the materials and input you use are within acceptable guidelines (for example, no copyright violation of your uploads, no sensitive or bad words for character inputs).
What payment methods do you offer?
You can pay via credit card, US bank account, Cash App, Google Pay, Klarna, Link by Stripe, or additional local payment methods based on your region.
How can I cancel my plan?
You can directly go to your account page to find the pause or cancel option for your subscription.
