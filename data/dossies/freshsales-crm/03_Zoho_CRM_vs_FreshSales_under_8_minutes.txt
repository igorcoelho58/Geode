 Hi everyone, this is Andy with Blonde.com and in this video we're going to compare Zahos Serim and Fresh Sales, also known as FreshWork Serim. These are two of the most popular Serim out there, so we will compare them in four different categories to see which ones are right for you and your business. Alright, let's get started. The first category is user interface. Fresh Sales has a modern interface that looks really good in Orgames. You can find a navigation bar on the left where all your modules are located, like contacts, accounts, and deals, and also any custom modules you have created. The home screen is your activities dashboard that can be customized if you need to. You can see the search bar at the top. Their record page shows any important information about it, as well as some artificial intelligence modules to help you understand more about the record in this case of contact. And below you can find related information like deals and activities. The deals module is organized in a common way, but you can change the view if you want. And you can edit the layouts as well as adding custom fields. The settings are very nicely organized, and it is easy to find what you're looking for, but you can use the search bar as well. On the other hand, Zohosirim doesn't look as modern as Fresh Sales. There are a lot of modules available besides the basics, and you can create custom modules as well. You also have a home screen that you can customize or use the classic view. The search bar is hidden behind this magnifier icon, and when you start typing, the results start showing up. The deals module looks similar to the one in Fresh Sales, and the records page has a very similar layout as well. You can scroll down to find more information, but this can be changed with a feature called Canva that we will go over later in the video. Also, the record page is super customizable, allowing you to show or hide sections, modify the field layout, add modules, and more. You can also see the timeline. When you open the settings for the first time, you may feel a little lost. There are so many options here. You can always use the search bar to find what you're looking for, but if you're not sure what you're searching for, sometimes it can be difficult to navigate. I think Fresh Sales interface looks more polished and has a better design that Zohosirim's interface. The different elements and settings look better in our better organized. Zohosirim has more modules and settings than Fresh Sales, making it more difficult to organize, but still, the user interface could be updated to a more modern design. Now, let's go over the top features of each app. Zohosirim comes with a lot of good features out of the box, but you will need some time to set them up. You can customize the layouts and fields, as well as having different layouts that can be assigned to different roles. Before I mentioned Canva, which is a feature that lets you design and customize what the modules look like. The automations and workflows are advanced, allowing you to send emails, update fields, create tasks, create new records, trigger webhugs, and trigger custom functions, which expands your possibilities. You can also set up blueprints to make sure your sales rep follow the sales process, as well as creating approval processes, set up assignment rules, marketing contributions, and run schedules. There's even a sandbox, so you can test your changes before deploying them to your live CRM. Fresh Sales includes a lot of features that go beyond a CRM, like a chat app that you can install on your website, and a team inbox where you can centralize all your emails and assign them to your employees. A marketing feature I like is journeys that allow you to create email workflows to target your leads or contacts. Regarding CRM features, you can customize your layouts and fields, create email templates, buy a phone number that will ring inside the CRM, and you can create workflows to automate your task creation, email notification, update fields, and trigger webhugs. So in this category, both apps are really close. They both include a lot of features out of the box, but I think SoHo's UM is slightly better because it is more customizable, and it has a lot of features that are related to a CRM. Some of the features in Fresh Sales are available as a separate app in the SoHo ecosystem. For example, if you need a chat on your website, you can use sales IQ that integrates with a CRM. So if you like SoHo's UM and you're looking for the extra functionality, you could try SoHo 1, which includes more than 40 SoHo apps to run your business. I will leave a link in the description. The next category we're going to compare is integrations. I always say that the CRM is the core of your business, so it is really important that it works with other apps that you use to run your organization. Their FreshWorks marketplace is where you will find all the integrations available for all the FreshWorks products, but you can fill them to see Fresh Sales integrations only. There are several categories from basic integrations like Google, Candle, Contacts, Gmail, and all the Office 365 products, as well as advanced integrations like Asana, Pandadok, MailChimp, Typeform, and more. The apps that have a blue marker are verified by FreshWorks, meaning that they have Test in them or even built them. You can also install the integration for Fresh This in case you're already using this app. SoHo's UM has a marketplace where all the integrations and extensions are. You can sync your Google or Microsoft email, calendar, and contact, as well as connected with other Zoho apps like Zoho projects, Survey, Desk, Analytics, Webinar, Sign, Campaigns, and Contrents. Zoho's UM has a bigger marketplace, but Fresh Sales integrates with most of the common apps that businesses use. So make sure to review the integrations that you need before choosing one of these apps. But if you already use one of the Zoho products, Zoho's UM will integrate better with them, and if you already use one of the FreshWorks apps, Fresh Sales is the best option. The last category we're going to go over is Price. Both apps have several plans available that vary in price and features, including a free plan. If you want to get all the features I mentioned in this video, the enterprise plan of Zoho's UM costs $40 per month, and the pro plan of Fresh Sales suede costs $39 per month. Zoho's UM has more CRM-oriented features, but FreshWorks suede allows you to use marketing tools like email marketing or chat in your website. Pricing wise, they're both really close, but I think it's better to get the extra marketing features of Fresh Sales instead of really advanced features of Zoho's UM that you might not end up using. Now, the Zoho One subscription dimension earlier costs $37 per user month, and it comes with other apps that provide all the marketing functionality, including the Fresh Sales. It is worth check out Zoho One. So these two CRM's are really good tools, and no matter which one you choose, it will do a great work. The two apps are advanced CRM's, so you will need some time to set up all the features available. I recommend Zoho's UM if you need a high level of customization, and you have the time and resources to set up the customizations and automations. The support team is okay, but most of the time you will have to do the work by yourself. But keep in mind that you won't get any of the extra features that come with Fresh Sales. If you like Zoho's UM and want more functionality, check out Zoho One. I recommend Fresh Sales if you need a solution that can take care of the sales and marketing efforts all in one place, but you don't want to get distracted with other apps that you probably don't need.
