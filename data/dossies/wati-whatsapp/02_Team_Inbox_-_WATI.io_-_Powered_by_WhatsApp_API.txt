 So in the WhatsApp Timing Box page, this is where you will receive all the incoming message and you're able to respond here. So let me show you. First of all, if I am sending a message to this number, let's say hi, then you will see it popping up in your Wattie page and this is a message that you receive as a auto reply. So here, you will see that this chat popped up as well and you will be able to see the incoming message that is sending out. So I said hi and for example, I want to ask about the pricing. And you will be able to see the incoming message as well and also the auto reply from the bot as well. So this I haven't answered manually here in the Timing Box but what you will be able to see here is first of all, the customer send incoming message of hi and there will be a bot reply message for them to select different options and also have a logo here that I sent out. I said in the automation as a auto reply message and when they type number three for the pricing, I also said an option to send out the PDF for them. So this is essentially what the Timing Box and the automation they can handle for you. And for example, whenever your customer send you an incoming message, you will be able to see it in the Timing Box as well. So other than that, the one of the key function here is the Tim collaboration. I am now looking at Crystal and what you can do here is if you do not want to board your answer, you will like to take the chat. You can click here. So the green one means that I'm online. So I assigned this chat to myself. So you will be able to see that I assigned this chat to myself in this blue box here. And I can basically type anything that I would like to input here to as an answer. And also what you can do as an agent, you can send attachment, emoji or like a reply that you sell out already. Then you can select right away here. And then just simply send it out as a quick reply. So as you can see here, all the reply, we have my name next to it. And everyone is accountable and the data is trackable for the message that sent from your side. You know when and who replied to this specific client. And also here on the top you can mark down this chat. What is the topic of this chat? For example, if it's a general inquiry or it's like shipping, ticketing or like pricing inquiry, then you can mark down right here. And in the middle you will see a green circle having a countdown of the 24 hour support session. You can also submit a sticker status depending on your need. So once you put pending here, for example, you can filter it with different status as well to see which kind of chat that you would like to track as well. And on the right hand side, you'll be able to see the WhatsApp name here of the client, the WhatsApp phone number. And you can easily add the AstroBuild here. So what you can do for example, these are the AstroBuild that I add for this number. And you can always add and delete. For example, I would like to add a new AstroBuild about, I don't know, like let's say season for example, spring. Then you can add a new AstroBuild right here. And what you can do with this is that you can filter it here. So when you click filter, add new salmon. And then you can simply type season, contains. And then let's say spring as we put just now. And this would be the only chat here showing up with this label, with this filter apply. And also lastly, you can put your shareboard notes here. So this can be some information that you can share across the team. So I think this site mostly clear here of the basic function of the team inbox. For the next video, we will explain more on the contact page.
