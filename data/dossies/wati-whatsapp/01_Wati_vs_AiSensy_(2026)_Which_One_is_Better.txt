 In this video, I will compare Wattie vs AI Sensi until you reach these WhatsApp engagement platforms maybe best for you and your needs and all comparing them in terms of their features, pricing, ease of use, customer reviews and tell you overall which one I would pick depending on your needs. So what do you mean? The main headline here is, quote your business on WhatsApp. So you can personalize communication and sell more with the WhatsApp business API platform that automates marketing, sales, service and support. So those are the four solutions of Wattie. So if you want to do marketing, sales, service or support on WhatsApp then Wattie could help you with that. AI Sensi on the other hand markets itself as the complete WhatsApp engagement platform and businesses drive 25 to 60% of revenues using AI Sensi. So you can do stuff like broadcasting, promotional offers, selling your products on WhatsApp, automating messages via integrations and enabling multi-agent live chat for customer support. So in terms of what they do, they are pretty similar. Now here you can see the main five features in AI Sensi. So again the broadcast messaging and live chat, smart chat bots that you can build, automating notifications and tracking analytics. Now I want to take a look at their integration since this is pretty important. So if you go to the app marketplace, you can scroll down right here and see what they offer. So you have an API integration which is free, so it's the public connect and razor-play. Now these ones right here are not free. But you have for example Shopify where you can automate a band-aid cards or the confirmations and more, you have WooCommerce OpenCard and a few more but for example through Pebli, you can connect with quite a few different tools and of course through API you can integrate with pretty much anything. Now what these integrations on the other hand you can see here, these are the main ones. So Zoho Shopify WooCommerce, Zapier and with Zapier you can connect with even more tools. They have HubSpot also Pebli connect, make aka Integromad, WhatsApp Shop, ChatBackup, Google SheetSender, Clavio and Zoho. Now for example with Shopify you can also do the abandoned card emails and customer support, whatever you would like to use it for. So we have established that in terms of features these tools are really really similar and the same with their integrations. Now in terms of ease of use I think Wattie is a little bit easier to use overall. Now next I would like to take a look at their pricing. So Wattie starts if you want to pay monthly at $49 per month and additional charges apply for conversations. Now in this plan there are five users included if you want more it will cost $12 per month. Then the pro plan is $99 per month at least that's what it starts at and again five users included. Now this plan you will need if you want to set up onmations, integrations and get powerful analytics. For most businesses you probably want to get the pro plan over the growth plan. They finally have the business plan which is quite advanced and the pricing is also quite expensive. It costs $299 per month and here you unlock stuff like a dedicated customer success manager and more free chatbot sessions per month and some more advanced features such as a custom domain for free. Now AI Census pricing we can see that right here. Now AI Census pricing in US dollars you can see it starts at 20 and if you want to have more conversations then of course it will be more expensive. Then a pro plan right here where you have unlimited users and you will do also have access to that any basic plan is for the five dollars per month and the enterprise plan has custom pricing. So in terms of pricing you will see that AI Census is a lot less expensive compared to Wati. You can see even in their cheapest plan you already get Shopify and WooCommerce integrations. So if you're looking for the most affordable tool then it does become clear that AI Census is the clearer winner and it is a great tool as well. However I think that the best tool is still Wati but it doesn't mean that everyone should pick it. If you have a pretty large budget to spend and you're going to do a really high volume of messages and conversations per month then I would go with Wati because then the initial subscription doesn't matter that much compared to how much you're spending on the actual conversations. But if you're going to do pretty low volume and you think maybe you do a few hundred conversations per month through the tool then I would go with AI Census and if pricing is also one of the most important factors for you then I would also go with AI Census because here you also have unlimited users so if you have more than five users with Wati you need to pay extra per user after that here it is unlimited. So again if you have a pretty large business and you're going to do a lot of conversations every single month then I would go with Wati and if you're anything about that then I would go with AI Census. Now if you want to get the seven day free trial no credit card required to Wati you can claim that through the link down in the description.
