 So we are now in the broadcast page. What you can do here first of all for this function you can send out a broadcast message to multiple content so it can be a campaign for a hundred or thousand people with the same template to send out. First of all you need to have your template approved by WhatsApp first in order the send out so they will screen out the message with like for example sensitive content or cold marketing message. This will be the thing that you would like to do before a half of the campaign that we would like to send out. So you can do it easily in a Wattie platform. First of all click the new template message. Put a template name here. Choose the category that is supported by WhatsApp. So I'll put a account update for example which here you can also select the language according to your needs which is all the WhatsApp support in language. Here now I will choose English and in the header session you can choose either multi-media. So for multi-media you can upload different format that WhatsApp support and remember to select the correct one when you upload it and you can also set a text as well as a title. So I'll put account update and in the body you can customize your message. For example high and then you would like to put your customer name and also message message like your account is active. So this is a simple message that I use as an example here and in the project session you can put different things like powder by your company and then in the button you can choose to put different button for call to action. For example visit a website which here we can put a Wattie website or a dynamic website which is specific to your clients account lock-in for example and you can also put a phone number for them to reach out to you and also you have an option for quick reply. So it's like a quick answer then you can save it right here. So just as a reminder for you you must upload and submit the template for approval. This part is entirely approved by WhatsApp so their SLA is within 48 hours for their approval or rejection and to my experience for English it's a really fast within an hour so just make sure that you will submit the template ahead of time if you need to send out a broadcast campaign. So you must wait for approval first in order to send out that template message and for more guideline you can click here to read from the WhatsApp official page and once the template is approved so now we are going to send out a broadcast with the approved message. For example you can just click here in the green button. Let's say just now we put let's put the same name test and play and you can just let approved it once so these are all approved it in the platform you can select it right away and now the time is 43 I'm going to send let's say 44 to schedule a time or date that you can do it here next is the left who to send to. So what I did in the contact pages now we have a list let's say for Hong Kong for anyone in Hong Kong we can just simply send out to the Hong Kong ones and you'll be able to see everyone here so I'll just let my test phone for example and you can also upload a list as well so this is three different ways to filter a group or select it directly here from the platform or upload Excel list so if it's already we can add broadcast and what you'll be able to see in this broadcast history tab. First of all you can see the remaining message essentially WhatsApp have a limit for the new user every day they will be able to send a thousand message within a 24 hours time frame and if you upgrade to tier two you can send 10,000 message per day and the third tier will be 100,000 per day so for this one for detail you will need to see how you can upgrade with the WhatsApp official page and secondly right here what you can see off the broadcast you can see the broadcast statistic for example the name the time, success for rate the number of content that you are sending out to and the status of the broadcast so when you click in here for the broadcast statistic you'll be able to see whether it is like Qing Desanile, success to Sanile or after it's Sanile it is it's like you know delivery or sends whether the customer read or reply your message so all this is really useful for marketing tracking as well because you are able to see how is the campaign performance of this broadcast so we will now weigh a bit for it to Sanile and it seems like right it is loading and completed so what I'm going to do here I will show you this message I have received as a webinar reminder which just now we sent out this broadcast campaign and you see the button as a more we said just now you can send yes no as a credit reply so let me let's say reply it your customer do not need to type any message with this kind of like button message so as I read a reply this campaign I can go back here and it is all trackable this number has reply your message so everything is trackable here and you can also download this for a further report so I hope this will be useful for you if you are not clear you can free free to contact us and for the next page I'm going to introduce the automation setup
