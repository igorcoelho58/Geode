Its functionality enables it to centralize all types of communication and collaborations. Within the business enterprise, it comes integrated with software automation features, solid email marketing, and file sharing options. It is priced fairly at $99 per month for unlimited users. All in all, the functionality and automation features combined give it an excellent SMB value, but improvements can be made on the software interface to make it simple to use.

It enables you to choose between using a leads listing and going direct to contact. What we did in like, it has a complex user interface.

This makes it ideal for any business looking to improve on lead management and collaboration. Things you should know before using Bittrix24. The user interface of Bittrix24 is a bit complex, and the functions are too many, which makes it a bit overwhelming to use. A big improvement would be to add an option that allows the user to add and remove features. It also falls short when it comes to customization, which makes it far less flexible compared to other CRM tools. Bittrix24 features. Reporting in third-party integration, Bittrix24 comes integrated with many tools, such as Zoho CRM, MailChimp, and Basecamp. It recently added a feature called Open Channels that enables you to integrate social media accounts such as Facebook, Skype, and Telegram. In addition, it offers compatibility with iOS and Android apps that enable you to access anything in your internet from tasks to the company drive. You can decide to connect the software using your Gmail account, which sends a notification to Bittrix24 when you get an email. However, in order for this to work, you will need to connect your own domain or use a Bittrix24.com email address. Lead management. The Lead Management feature recently got new additions, which include Lead Capture Forms and Web-based Forms. These forms are accessible and editable from the Bittrix24 CRM activity stream and can also be connected to Google Analytics by adding the ID to the form designer. Leads are usually listed by a company, and you can choose between a traditional list view and a can-band view that lets you move entries along your pipeline. Also, the user interface that creates automated rules and actions is easy to understand, since a number of pre-coded automations are included. CRM, this feature helps your sales team get funnel management tools, pipeline management, sales reports, and support for repeat customers, as well as sales automation tools. The sales team can get a quick snapshot of their current pipeline and see who is moving through the funnel and who's standing still. This feature also tracks all the marketing costs and determines your return on spend to see which marketing campaigns you can continue and which you should shut down. It can even track things like keywords and channels that will offer the lowest acquisition cost. When you are initially setting it up, you can choose between a simple CRM and a classic CRM. The simple CRM is recommended for small businesses and sales departments, which moves all the inbound data directly to the contacts or deal listings, while the classic CRM starts inbound inquiries as leads, and then lets the sales staff convert them to contacts or deals. If the company's CRM has a product catalog, specific products can be associated with the form which can then be inserted on the webpage or as a pop-up window. Websites, Bittrix24 comes with an amazing and free visual website builder that has landing pages and e-commerce stores that are fully drag and drop. It also includes free domains, hosting and templates that are mobile optimized and responsive. All these give you not only an amazing CRM, but an entire enterprise management system, contact center. This feature enables you to have a live chat on your website and provide social networking tools that help keep communication with your clients active. This tool is not only useful for your team, but also helps improve on customer service. Final verdict. Should you use Bittrix24? Bittrix24 is an amazing and powerful CRM tool.
