About Us
A little backstory
The history of Bitrix24 dates back to the late 2000s. Having originally developed it around the time iPhone 4 came out, we thought we’d create some platform we could use for communication and collaboration inside Bitrix24. Our productivity increased almost immediately and everyone on the team seemed to like the new approach.
A year or so later, we thought “Hey, we have this really great CRM we’re offering to our clients - why not marry it with the online collaboration platform we’re using inside the company?”. The idea took off and the initial beta-testing showed very promising results, which inspired us to commit to the product full-time and finally release it to the public in April of 2012.
It was an instant success for both us and our clients and partners. Bitrix24 has been growing ever since and is currently used by over 15 million organizations worldwide - from businesses to non-profits.
