further Ado let's begin
okay so the first thing you need to do
is to log in using your credentials if
this is your first time here intercom

free trial option and from here all you
have to do is just provide all the
information necessary you can use your
work or business email you can continue

set okay so once you have your account
setup remember that intercom is a
powerful customer communication platform
that offers a range of tools for
businesses to engage with their
customers through a live chat as you can
see it from here in the support Channel
targeted messages and more all right so
the thing with intercom you can explore
the dashboard right here once you
install and set it up you can take some
time to familiarize with yourself with
the dashboard layout normal in the left
side panel as you can see this is your
inbox and right now you can click on the
setup
channels and from here you can install
the messenger and more channels to
connect with their customers so you have
an option to click on the messenger when
you click on
it when you install the messenger you
can simply talk to your customers all
right because the messenger lets you
talk to your customers on your website
or app or even send in in messages and
of course send customer data to intercom
for a more personalized experience so
you have an option for the web iOS if
you're using an Android you can do it as
well or you can install Messenger on
your site or web app now let's go back
again to General um
dashboard again from here in the inbox
tab right here you can configure your
messages
settings right you can you can
uh you you can use macros for shortcuts
and you can customize your welcome
message such as
maybe something like this one you can
also set up some autor responses and
other messaging settings to suit your
business needs like say for example this
one so there's a lot that you can
explore on here the uh
ellipses gives an option to export or
ticket you can even show your tickets
right here you can assign this um ticket
to one of your support channels right
here to one teammate say for example
you're collaborating with a project and
you have also a teammate within your
organization you can assign this ticket
to right but if we not right now don't
have a teammate but if you have an
option to just do it and in terms of the
conversations right here that's what I'm
um
trying to say because you can um add
some T in and support the more
information and if you want to
understand your team's volume and
capacity click on the get
feature but
obviously once you created the free plan
you have 4 days left in your Advanced
trial but again if you are scaling up
you might want to take advantage of the
essential um plan which is $39 per month
but here you can get customer support
plan for individual startups and small
businesses and these are the products
and benefits that you can explore and
take advantage when you use this
essential plan if you wanted to scale up
you can go to the advance and expert and
here are side by-side comparisons to
help you make an informed decision all
right now let's skip this for now let's
go to the automation or or maybe the app
store first because in the app store
right here these are the
popular apps that you can
connect into your intercom so um this
Tri payment Gateway Salesforce Joc Cloud
Google analytics WhatsApp all right so
um if you are a heavy user of these
platforms it's very convenient and you
can maximize and you can fully exhaust
the intercom tools with this app store
right
here right now in my team we are using a
MailChimp right say for example we're
going to be clicking on the MailChimp
all you have to do say for example in
this situation click on install now and
from here you can leverage MailChimp
data inside and
out so MailChimp wants to access andig
good which is us the people companies
and all a lot more just click on
authorized access and from here all you
have to do is just follow the on screen
instructions so you can automate this
two
platform right
here and once you've done that all right
you can customize all these settings and
preferences when
you integrated mail Cham to your inner
Chrome account so it's the same process
for the uh other platforms here right
just choose the uh services that you
have an account and just click on it if
you have now the next thing is when we
go to the automation process right so
they support a lot but in my case I am
using um a platform
called woocommerce right here so in my
store because I'm uh I run a Pages for
my store so if you want
to integrate woocommerce to your
intercome that's doable and possible all
you're going to do is just click on it
and also it's also um have an
integration and automation to Wordpress
so there's a lot that you can do you can
also go to the uh search for n app maybe
look let's look for elementer if they
have
it say no they don't have they don't
support
elementer but let's go to the uh CRM
because this is one of the best um
platform for crms because I am using
HubSpot and when
you install HubSpot here what will
happen is it'll keep you up to date and
view important hobot data on leads and
customers right from the Inc com inbox
all right it enables you to stay up to
date automatically syncing new leads you
capture along with qualification data
you collect and from here now in terms
of the
uh contacts
here again you can install the messenger
to view segment and filter your customer
data when you install messenger you can
track data here and you can craft the
best customer experience using a
complete picture of your customer's data
and past actions so you can also add an
uh have a filter here some such as
name web session City owner and a lot
more even lead category right so there's
more options
here which is for advanc
analytics when you click on the
proactive support all
right as you can see you can proactively
support your customers without bone
messages you can resolve customer issues
before they contact you all right now
you can set up a new message right here
you can start from scratch for from chat
Banner email checklist SMS but for now
we're going to the chat because we can
customize encraft messages right here so
we can um monitor incoming messages and
respond to customer inquiries in real
time using the live chat feature all
right and as you can see you can put
some customization
here you can customize your welcome
message autor responses and other
messaging settings to suit your business
business needs and again you can explore
different messaging channels such as
live chat email and inapp messages you
can even set some rules if you wanted
now in terms of the reports right
here here you can analyze incomes tools
to track the performance of your
messaging campaigns and custom
interactions all right now the monitor

volume and customer satisfaction to
identify areas for improvement but
there's a lot you can also explore
Advanced features as you become more
