users to better engage their customers
with one-off messages or fully
integrated omni-channel campaigns
engagement is fostered at each step of
the process with onboarding product
walk-throughs and tours from within the
product itself for new customers updates
announcements or proactive support like
tips and insights are sent to current
users from within or out of the app and
surveys help to gather useful customer
feedback unfortunately one of the issues
that users have with many of these extra
features is that intercom will get
caught by some ad blockers thus hiding
this content from a portion of users
audiences

is another focus of intercom system and
they provide tools to help this cause

customized workflows that route the
right customers to the right live agents

system these integrations are in
addition to intercom's ability to embed
their services into users websites
