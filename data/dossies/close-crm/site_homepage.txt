Why small businesses love Close.
Yes, love. (Really.)
"Streamlined CRM that helps us close more deals, faster."
Close is built for sales teams that want speed, clarity, and results. The built-in calling and email features are extremely efficientâit cuts down the need to switch between tools. Its automation features save a ton of time and boost productivity. Itâs truly a CRM that feels like it was built by people who understand sales.

"Very Efficient and easy to use"
The most helpful thing about Close is the fact that it links your work email to the CRM, which makes it easier to use. The calling is super smooth, as well as the email and SMS templates. Overall, Close is one of the best CRMs that I've used, and I look forward to keeping using it in the future.

"Close is for closers."
Close is amazing! It is expertly built for sales teams to keep the pertinent information in front of you to make those items actionable and make follow-up very easy and central to your day. The clean UX and ease of use is like no other platform we've used. It was very easy to set up, and the implementation of our sales process with the other systems we use is top-notch!

"Everything a small business needs at a cost we can manage"
Close offers a very simple user interface that is pretty intuitive and requires little or no training to get started using the basic features. As a former user of maybe the biggest player in the CRM space while at a former company, I can confidently say that I have gotten more value out of Close, even at a much more reasonable price point.

Seamless navigation, quick learning curve, unbelievable customer support"
I love that Close has everything all in one place when going to review my day. I can see the tasks I need to complete, my schedule, and new leads that have come in. If there is ever any issue, customer support is always quick to respond!
