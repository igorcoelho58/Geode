Why small businesses love Close.
Yes, love. (Really.)
It has everything, including a good dialer, emailer, SMS, as well as Salesforce-like CRM functionalities. Also is automation friendly, and extremely customizable. The best CRM & Sales Engagement platform on the market. Getting it setup and implemented is super easy. Integrations are also seamlessly doable. I use it daily for outreach and data management.

Sales Professional
Keeps my contacts organized and my messages in one app/platform. Even though we're a small construction company, our contact list still grows each year. I've finally gotten everyone off my phone and into something more functional and robust where I can take genuine time off the tools and talk with customers and my building partners.
Chad H.
Director
Close is one of the best CRM tools that helps manage tasks with its awesome features like the built-in communication and reporting tools. It is very easy to use and helps to close deals sooner. The interface is very simple; we can have it all at one place â all emails, conversations with customers are well organized and easy to set up.
