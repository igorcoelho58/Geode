Mother Earth
Our most notable core value is to build a house you want to live in. Weâd like to live in a âhouseâ with abundant water, clean air, and renewable energy sources that allow for future generations to live freely on our planet.
Thatâs why we donate 1% of our revenue to
Stripe Climate.
Our contributionsââalong with those of many other ambitious businessesââpromote research and use of technology that removes carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. There is no greater challenge than reversing the effects of climate change. Close is proud to commit resources to help solve this challenge.

To put it simply, everyone at Close is very good at their jobs. It puts your mind at ease, and pushes you to also one-up your own game when youâre around so many talented individuals. At the same time, there is very little ego, or drama, or politics. Itâs just a bunch of reasonable adults doing great work together.
Scott Mahr
Staff Frontend Engineer
Our values encourage us to examine long-term thinkingâthat means doing great short-term work, but also building processes and relationships to support the future. For me, this is a new way of thinking and it has prompted a lot of creativity and innovation. Plus, it encourages work-life harmony!
Maddie Tierney
Talent Lead
There really is something about Close that sets it apart from all the other companies that Iâve worked for. A huge part of that being the people. Iâve never encountered such kind-hearted and caring group who genuinely care about each other and each otherâs success.
Kaylee Novak

Close is the best company I've ever worked for. From our honest CEO through all our confident directors, this is an environment that rewards high-quality work and great adventure over mindless hours. It's a remarkably caring company in a remote setting.

What to expect in the
Close hiring process
We care deeply about the candidate experience, so each interview flow may vary depending on the role. We strive to provide an environment that respects the time and energy of both our candidates and internal team.
Application Review
Our application process promotes equitable and unbiased hiring practices. We ask a short series of questions, similar to what you would be asked in the first interview. This helps us learn more about you right from the start, so please be sure to answer each question thoughtfully. All applications are reviewed by a team member; qualified applications undergo secondary review. Regardless of fit, we will let you know if you're moving forward.
Intro Call
You'll first meet with the hiring manager or People Operations team. We seek to understand you, your background, professional goals, and whatâs important to you when choosing your next position and company. This call is an opportunity for you to ask questions about the role, company, culture, values, or product.
Skills Assessment
This is a hypothetical prompt designed to resemble key aspects of this role's responsibilities. Each take-home project is thoughtfully designed by the hiring manager to include a grading system, concise directions, and clear goals. These projects may take between 3-6 hours to complete depending on the role. However, we never use your work product.
Video Interviews
After the skills assessment, we'll dive into your technical skills during 1 to 2 interviews hosted by your potential colleagues. This step focuses on the specifics of the role and provides you an opportunity to ask the team about their experiences at Close.
Video Interview with Leadership
Interviews conclude with a 1:1, 30-minute call with someone on our Leadership team. These are typically honest conversations that allow you the opportunity to discuss any outstanding questions. Our Leadership team are active leaders at Close and genuinely interested in every person who joins the team.
Reference and Background Checks
Weâll ask you to provide three references who can speak to your professional experienceââideally at least one of whom you've reported to. These calls help us validate what we already believe to be true based on our interviews with you.
