 If you're one of those folks who's been using other, but starting to have second thoughts about security, or maybe you're just looking for something more comprehensive, then basic transcription, then today's video is going to be perfect for you. My name is Daniel and today, I want to introduce you to Fellow, which I genuinely believe is the ideal alternative for leaders who need way more than just transcription from their meeting assistant. Here's the thing, guys. Unlike Otter, Fellow actually supports your entire meeting life cycle, with a laser focus on org-wide security and access controls. And let me tell you, as executives and team leaders, we need way more than just someone transcribing what we say. We need a comprehensive tool that actually helps us throughout the entire meeting process. Fellow is basically an AI-powered meeting assistant that's designed to help you before your meetings, during your meetings, and after your meetings. Plus, here's something interesting. Otter doesn't even offer video recording capabilities. Sure, it can transcribe videos that are played out loud or uploaded, but it can't actually record video content from your meetings like Fellow can. But let's talk about that in more detail. Guys, make sure you check out all the useful links in the description. After watching this video, there might be some nice discounts there. Let's get started. Fellow's key features overview. All right folks, so before we dive deep into each feature, let me give you a quick overview of what we're going to cover today. We're talking about privacy controls that actually let admins manage what gets recorded and ensure compliance, something that's absolutely crucial these days. We'll look at Fellow's security and trust features, including SOC2 and HIPAA compliance, which means your sensitive data is actually handled securely. Then we're going to explore Fellow's meeting recaps that capture every single detail with unmatched accuracy. So you never miss those key points that could make or break your next quarter. I'll show you Ask Fellow, which is basically like having a super smart chief of staff who gathers and organizes insights from every meeting you're invited to. Trust me, this feature alone will change how you think about meeting productivity. And finally, we'll talk about pre-meeting briefs and integrations with CRM and project management tools that author simply doesn't offer. So stick around because this is going to be good. Recording rules and restrictions. Now let's talk about one of Fellow's absolute standout advantages, how it handles the recording and privacy aspect of AI note-taking. My friends, this is a crucial concern, especially for leadership teams. When you've got an AI recording your organization's sensitive meetings, you want complete control over what gets recorded, who can access it and how that data gets used. Fellow was built with exactly these needs in mind and it offers way more granular controls than author ever could. Here's what I'm talking about. With Fellow, your organization can establish strict rules and policies for recordings through what they call admin recording policies. Your administrators can control which meetings can get recorded and who's allowed to use the AI note-taker right down to the specific team or meeting type. So you might allow recording in your general team meetings but completely disable it for legal finance or board meetings. These rules make sure nobody accidentally records a meeting that should stay off the record. But it gets even better guys. All those meeting recordings, transcripts, and summaries that fellow captures get stored in a central secure meeting library. Within this library you can create custom channels or folders and set permissions on each one. This means only authorized people can access a given meetings content. Picture this, you might have a channel called Executive Team Meetings that only executives and their chiefs of staff can open. Fellow ensures your meeting knowledge stays exactly where it belongs in the right hands. Now compare that to author which just stores recordings in a user's account that they can share via link. It's a much simpler model, sure, but it doesn't offer anywhere near the same level of controlled workspace-wide sharing. For an Executive Handling Sensitive Information, Fellow's controlled access model is absolutely perfect. Pause and Redaction Features. Here's the cool part guys. Fellow lets you pause recording with just one click whenever sensitive topics come up in meetings. This instantly stops the AI from recording or transcribing until you're ready to resume, like an instant off the record switch. Other on the other hand doesn't have a pause feature. To stop recording you'd have to remove its bot from the meeting and remember to add it back later. Super inconvenient. Fellow also offers pause meeting reduction, letting admins permanently delete specific audio, video, and transcript segments. So if something confidential slipped through, you can erase it completely with a few clicks. Other doesn't have this level of control. You can only delete whole meetings or edit text, but not remove parts of the recording itself. Fellow's pause and Redact Features give you precise control to keep sensitive info out of your meeting records. Guys, before we move on, I try to make my content fun instead of boring. And in return, please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you enjoy the content I make. Enterprise great security and compliance. Now folks, for larger organizations and regulated industries, trust matters more than flashy features. Fellow stands out here as an Enterprise Ready solution, built with security and compliance at its core, crucial for handling sensitive data. Fellow is SOC2 type 2 certified, GDPR compliant, and offers high-pile compliance with business associate agreements for health care clients. Other while SOC2 compliant isn't hip-ass certified, and won't sign those agreements, making it unsuitable for many regulated fields. On data privacy, fellow ensures your data stays yours. They don't use meeting content to train AI and delete it immediately after processing. All data isn't cryptid in transit and at rest. Others privacy policy is less clear on AI training use and has raised user concerns in the past. Also, fellow supports transcription in 99 languages, while auto only supports 3 as of 2025, making fellow far better for international teams, needing multilingual support. In short, fellow offers stronger compliance, clearer privacy, and wider language support, making it the safer choice for enterprises with sensitive data. Pre, during, and post meeting support. Here's where fellow really shines, my friends. It goes beyond basic transcription by supporting your entire meeting process, from prep to follow-up, with tools other simply doesn't offer. Before meetings fellow provides collaborative agendas, hundreds of templates, and AI-powered briefs that summarize past discussions and action items so everyone arrives prepared. Other doesn't have built-in agendas, templates, or AI prep tools. During meetings, fellows real-time transcription, links notes to topics, and organizes action items and decisions, making follow-up easy. Other records but lacks agenda integration, editing flexibility, and features like pause or redact. After meetings, fellow delivers AI-generated summaries, automatic follow-up emails, and integrates with tasks and CRM tools like Asana, Gira, Salesforce, and more. Other offers only basic transcripts with highlights and no cross-meeting search. Fellowes full meeting lifecycle support makes it a far more powerful solution for executives and team leaders. Ask fellow, your super smart AI chief of staff. One of fellow's standout features is Ask Fellow, an AI assistant that doesn't just transcribe your meetings, but actually understands and analyzes them for you. You can chat with it any time to get quick summaries, key decisions, or even sentiment analysis. Ask fellow lets you ask questions like, what were the main decisions, or how was the team feeling during this discussion and get instant clear answers. It can track sentiment over multiple meetings too, helping you see if your team's mood is positive, cautious, or uncertain. The real power is in its ability to analyze trends across meetings. You can ask how your O-Cars are progressing, or if your team's aligned on goals, and Ask Fellow will pull insights from all past conversations. Basically, it turns your meeting data into actionable intelligence, saving you hours of digging through transcripts. Whether you want quick summaries or long-term trends, Ask Fellow helps you make smarter decisions faster. Conclusion. My friends, here's the bottom line. Fellow isn't just an other alternative. It's a complete upgrade. It combines all of others' transcription capabilities with powerful extras like agenda templates, intelligent AI assistants, enterprise grade security, and full compliance features. This makes Fellow the absolute go-to choice for organizations that want to harness AI in their meetings without compromising on preparation, privacy, or productivity. For leaders like you who sit in countless meetings and need real outcomes from each one, Fellow acts like a true chief of staff. It ensures every meeting is well run, every decision gets noted, and every follow-up actually happens. This is the modern way to run meetings, guys, and it's exactly why Fellow is the best choice for anyone considering making the switch from other. I'm always testing out new productivity tools and sharing my honest thoughts with you folks. Let me know in the comments if you've tried Fellow, or if you have any questions about making the switch.
