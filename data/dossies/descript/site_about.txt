About Descript
Descript is a video editing app that does it all. It makes it easy for anyone to record, edit, and share any video, and it’s got all the power you need to create something you’re proud of.
In Descript your team can make video together without a bunch of annoying file sharing. If you work alone, by choice or because of your insufferable perfectionism, you can collaborate with Underlord, Descript’s built-in, eager-to-please AI co-editor.
Descript was invented by a team of creative people who hated working in the timeline and knew there must be a better way. Turns out there were lots of better ways—text-based editing, automated design, prompt-based editing, and soon, ocular implants.
We’re not really doing implants, we just said it to impress potential investors. Speaking of, Descript has raised a total of $100M, primarily from the OpenAI Startup Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint Ventures, and Spark Capital. Among our individual investors: Daniel Gross, Devdatta Akhawe, Alex Blumberg, Jack Conte, Justine Ezarik, Todd Goldberg, Jean-Denis Greze, John Lilly, Tobi Lutke, Bharat Mediratta, Shishir Mehrotra, Casey Neistat, Brian Pokorny, Raghavendra Prabhu, Lenny Rachitsky, Naval Ravikant, Jay Simons, Jake Shapiro, Rahul Vohra, and Ev Williams.
We’ve got an incredible team. Some come from the creator world, some from the tech world, and some from the spirit world (who we don’t pay, for tax reasons). If you’re interested in making things that don’t exist but probably should, we hope you’ll consider joining Descript.
