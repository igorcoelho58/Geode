Empowering small businesses to grow
Every company needs the right tools to blossom. To scale your business, you need software that’s accessible, offers the right functionality, is quick to master and highlights key opportunities.
Pipedrive is designed to help small businesses grow. For over ten years, we’ve been committed to building the best CRM – a CRM by and for
salespeople
. The result is an easy-to-use, effective sales tool that centralizes your data, helping you visualize your entire sales process and win more deals.
A CRM built by salespeople, for salespeople
Our story began in an Estonian garage in 2010. Pipedrive’s co-founders were salespeople who needed more from a CRM tool than the software on the market could offer. So, they built an easy-to-use, visual sales platform to help users streamline their processes and get more done.
Since then, we’ve grown into a global unicorn. Our team of 850+ people across eight countries works tirelessly toward one goal: empowering small businesses everywhere to succeed.
Backed by global investment firm Vista Equity Partners and with the support of our thriving community, we continuously strive to push the boundaries of what an easy-to-use and effective sales CRM can do to help small businesses win more deals.
Our CRM mission statement
Pipedrive is the easy and effective CRM for small and medium-sized companies.
We empower SMBs to unlock their business potential and scale with our easy-to-use, affordable and effective CRM.
With Pipedrive, you can track your sales pipeline, manage leads and automate your entire sales process from one central place – so you can focus on selling. Stay organized, productive and efficient, with access to multiple integrations, automation, reporting, dashboards and more.

A brief history of CRM
CRM has its roots in the 1980s, when businesses needed better ways to manage customer interaction. The turn of the millennium ushered in cloud-based CRM, making the software more accessible and scalable.
Pipedrive pioneered the use of a kanban pipeline in customer relationship management – a feature vital to today’s CRMs.
Contemporary CRM solutions such as Pipedrive are effective, customizable tools that deliver valuable performance data, enabling multi-channel engagement. They empower businesses to cultivate enduring customer relationships, especially when harnessing the capabilities of smart technology and AI.
