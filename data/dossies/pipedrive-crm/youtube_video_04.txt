below to learn more about my pipedrive
Consulting options now to begin this
video let me explain what pipedrive is
so you can decide if it's the right tool
for you and I'll explain how it's a
little bit different to other sales crms
on the market like Salesforce Monday and
HubSpot
so first and foremost pipedrive is what
I would call a sales CRM it's a tool
that you can use to track the different
sales opportunities or what we call
deals through the various stages of a
sales process and on that deal you can
store everything related to the sale you
can put your notes you can create
activities to remind you when to follow
up and you can see your email
communication with the people you're
selling to when you use pipedrive
correctly I think it can help you to
close more deals and generate more
revenue for your business because you
are following up in a more efficient and
timely manner and you're not letting
good sales opportunities get missed or
fall through the cracks I've been using
pipedrive since 2015 when I started
using it I was working in mortgages and
then I became a pipe rev consultant and
took my business full time and I've been
using it to run my Consulting business
ever since we actually don't consult on
any other CRM because we use pipedrive
every single day it's what we know
really well and quite honestly we think
it's the best pipedrive is what I would
call my source of truth it's where I of
course manage all my sales opportunities
but it's also my master contact list so
every client I've ever worked with but
also just other professional contacts
that I'm in touch with I put all of
those people in pipedrive so I can
manage all of my important relationships
in one place in terms of how pipedrive
is different to other crms on the market
of course I'm a little bit biased but I
think pipedrive is simple and easy to
use and a lot of the clients we work
with agree I also think it's quite a lot
more affordable than a lot of other crms
and check out this video I'll link above
to look at my video on pricing and the
different pricing packages and add-ons
for pipedrive pipedrive was originally
designed by sales people who were
frustrated with the crms on the market
and they designed pipedrive for sales
people with the emphasis on making it
easy to use because if sales people like
and enjoy using the CRM they're more
likely to keep it up to date and the
tool is more useful but that's enough
talking for now let's get into it and
let's have a look at how to get started
with pipedrive so here I am logged into
my demo account of pipedrive and at the
moment I'm on the main deals page here's
the sidebar here's the navigation here
I'm just on the deals screen at the
moment and I'm looking at all of the
different deals or sales opportunities
and I can see where they are at in my my
sales process I'm going to come back to
that to explain the navigation options
on the left here at the top we have the
leads inbox this is where I can upload
for example a spreadsheet of prospects
or leads that I want to cold call or
reach out to you know I haven't yet
qualified these people yet and I need to
qualify them before I convert them into
deals
I could also use some of pipedrive's uh
lead booster features here like live
chat chatbot and web forms and I can
feed leads from my website directly into
my pipedrive account
so that's the leading box we also have
like I showed you before the deal
pipeline I can see the qualified sales
opportunities and where they're at in my
sales process and I can set up multiple
pipelines for different types of Revenue
or different sales Journeys for my
business pipedrive also has a projects
add-on this is where I could create
projects to manage what we need to do
after we win a deal so for actually you
know delivering our product or service I
can create and manage projects in here
I can also create and send marketing
campaigns so instead of having to
connect third-party tools like MailChimp
or activecampaign I could actually do my
marketing from here
we have the inbox or mail inbox where I
can see my email my connected Google or
my Microsoft account and I can see email
that's coming in and syncing with
pipedrive
we have the activities list this is
where I can see what activities I have
due today for the deals and leads that I
need to follow up on
we have an area for contacts this could
be either people or organizations that
I'm selling to this is where I can see
everyone in my database and and access
important contact information
on the insights tab I can view
dashboards I can create reports to
report on how my sales team are
performing I can understand our
conversion rates and why we're why we're
winning or losing deals
in the products tab I can set up my
products for the various products or
services that we offer which I can then
attach to my deals and then we have this
Marketplace tab where I can connect
other third-party software to my
pipedrive account and a couple more
options here in the more options menu
next I'm going to explain how
information is organized in pipedrive
and this is where maybe pipedrive is a
little bit different to other crms
you've possibly used in the past so on
the deals page here we can see the
different deals or again think of them
as sales opportunities that we're
working on now if I open one of these
deals we're on the deal page here and on
the left I can see the contact person
and the organization that this deal is
linked to now some crms work a little
bit differently where you have a contact
person and the contact person themself
is the lead or is the sales opportunity
and so you simply create a contact and
just specify that it's a lead with
pipedrive it's different you create a
lead or a deal in this case and you link
that deal to a person and to an
organization and it's important to
understand how contacts and
organizations and deals are linked
together because it creates a bit of a
hierarchy
for example I have apple here so apple
is an organization that we are selling
to or in this case I've labeled them as
a customer
and down here on my sidebar I can see
the different people or employees that
work at Apple so I can go here to Tim
Cook and now I'm on the contact page for
Tim Cook I can see the name up here I
can see all of Tim's contact information
and details and if I scroll down I can
see that Tim is linked to the Apple
organization
and any notes I put on here activities I
log like these ones or emails that I
send to Tim Kirk anything I do on this
contact will actually get summarized at
the organization level so if I go back
to the organization here you can see
this timeline where I can see activities
some of them here are linked to Tim Cook
some are linked here one to Johnny Ive a
couple more to Johnny and if I scroll
down
I can see some notes Here linked with
you know this Tim Cook deal so at the
organization level I can see all of the
notes emails and activities that are
associated with any of those contacts
and because everything is linked I get
this nice big sort of 10 000 foot view
of all of our activity and interactions
with the company here on the
organization level and at the top here I
can see the different deals that we have
linked with Apple so I could actually
have multiple deals or sales
opportunities running simultaneously for
an organization
so if I go to this Tim Cook Apple deal
here again I can see the deal is linked
to Tim and the Apple organization and so
again any notes any activities any
emails I put here on this deal will all
show up both on the Tim Cook contact and
the Apple organization
and if I go back to Apple now if I go to
the Johnny Ive deal you can see this
deal is still linked with apple but it's
linked to the Johnny Ive contact so
these notes and activities will all show
up on the Johnny I've contact and on the
Apple organization it's important to
wrap your head around this early on
because I see a lot of people making
mistakes especially when it comes to
importing contacts to pipedrive they
import a list of contacts but they
haven't actually created a deal through
that import process and so when they
look at their deal pipeline they go Hey
where's all my deals and so you need to
create a deal and make sure it's linked
to a contact person and an organization
okay with that out of the way let me
give you some tips on where to start in
terms of customizing your pipedrive
account the first thing I would do when
setting up your pipedrive account is
customize your pipeline and these stages
now as I mentioned before you can have
multiple sales pipelines which you
really only need to do if you have
different sales you know Revenue streams
or quite different sales processes so
here's a pretty normal sales pipeline
where I've got qualified leads coming in
here from my lead inbox I book a meeting
I Define the client's needs send a
proposal and then send a contract
if I go to my mortgage pipeline you can
see the stages are quite different we've
still got qualified lead but then
interview complete we have to get
documents submit applications to lenders
the stages here or the Milestones that
we need to accomplish are quite
different
one of the mistakes we see people making
is creating too many pipelines pipelines
for different sales people or different
regions but you can filter your pipeline
up here we can view only the deals
linked with certain sales people so I
can see which deals each person on my
team is managing and I can also use
filters to look at deals in specific
regions or different types of deals to
customize your pipeline you can click
the edit button up here
and from here we can rename and change
the how we want to name these stages I
can also drag and drop to reorder them
and I can click here to add new stages
if I need to and when defining your
stages I recommend thinking about what
are the major Milestones or things we
need to do to progress a sales
opportunity you know and get it closer
to a confirmed sale so in this case you
know we need to book a meeting first and
you can see I've actually phrased my
deals in all my stages in the past tense
so it's very clear deals in this stage
we've got a meeting booked but we
haven't completed it yet needs to find
is we've now completed the meeting and
we've defined what it is they need help
with proposal sent clearly defines that
everyone in this stage has received the
proposal and now they're you know making
a decision and then people in the final
stage they've received the contract and
now they need to sign so this makes it
very clear when I look at my deals here
I know exactly where each person is I
know that these people you know are
making their decision now when
customizing my pipeline I can also
enable this rotting feature so you can
see here I haven't done it for all my
stages but for my proposal sense stage
I've said
deals should start to rot in 14 days so
this basically means if a deal is
inactive in other words I haven't
touched the deal I haven't updated it I
haven't logged an activity I haven't
followed up with an email I haven't
changed the deal in any way within this
14 day window then the deal turns pink
and it has this little red warning here
so this tells me that this deal has been
rotting for 49 days so if you look at
your sales Pipeline and you see lots of
pink deals that's obviously an
indication that deals are not being
followed up in a timely manner if I then
do something to this deal let's let's
click on the little activity icon here
let's say I decide to follow up today so
I'll reschedule this activity let's say
I'm going to schedule this to today
instead you can see now the deal turns
white it's no longer rotting because
I've now updated the deal you can also
see at the top of your pipeline the
total value here of all the deals in
this pipeline so this is basically the
sum of of these values here so I can see
what is the value or potential Revenue
we can get from all of these different
deals
and I'm also given a weighted value so
because I'm unlikely to win every single
one of these deals I don't know my
conversion rate is not 100
pipedrive is helping me to estimate what
is the likely Revenue I'm likely to get
from these deals and the way this
weighted value is calculated is if I
edit my pipeline stages here you can see
there are these probabilities so
starting from the left a qualified lead
has about a 40 chance of being one at
that stage but as I progress as I have a
meeting to find their needs send a
proposal and send a contract you can see
the probability is increasing up to the
point where if they've got a contract
the deal is about 95 of the time going
to convert
and so those probabilities get
multiplied by the deal values to give me
this weighted value and that just helps
me understand what is the potential or
more likely Revenue that I'm going to
get from these deals so there are a few
different ways I can view my deals this
is the normal pipeline view which we're
on up here
this is probably what you'll use most of
the time but there is also this list
view if I want to sort of see my deals
in more of like a spreadsheet table
format I can customize these columns and
choose to display things like the value
of the deal the deal type any of my
custom Fields I can show in here this is
useful either if you plan to export your
data you can export this View and all
the columns down into Excel if you need
to use that data in any way
or from this view I can bulk update I
can either select all my deals or I can
select specific deals and then I can
make bulk changes on the right hand side
if I want to change deals to a certain
stage or change the owner of those deals
and finally we have a forecast view this
is only available to users on the
professional plan and what this helps me
do is understand what is the likely
Revenue I'm likely to generate this
month based on the expected close date
of my deals so if we take a look at this
Bruce Wayne deal here on the left here
is the expected close date this is
generally something you put on the deal
when you're kind of further along in
your sales process maybe Bruce has said
look we're really interested in in
buying your service we're going to be
signing up I would put an expected close
date to represent when I expect to win
this deal by and so with that date I can
then see the total value of deals I
expect to win this month or coming up in
the following months now once you have
your pipeline ready and you've defined
your sales stages I would recommend
creating a deal so that you can start
playing with piperrive and getting
familiar with the system
to create a deal you can simply click
the quick add button up here and you can
click deal or you can just use the
shortcut d
and it's going to pop up this input menu
now when you create the deal it's going
to ask you to link the deal to a contact
person and an organization now if you
type the name of a contact that already
exists give pipedrive a second you can
see I can then click here Tim Cook and
it's going to link this deal to the Tim
Cook contact and the Apple organization
that way I'm linking this deal to my
existing contact in the system
or I can type the name of a new contact
Elon Musk and you can see here it
couldn't find an Elon Musk so it's going
to say add as a new contact and you see
the little new indicator there
and we need to put in a company for Elon
which company should we use let's use
SpaceX
again it's going to try and search for
an organization it can't find one so
we're going to create the organization
as well
I can if I want I can input some details
for Elon on the right hand side Elon at
SpaceX
.com
and I can fill in some information if I
know the value of the deal I probably
don't at this early stage if I know the
expected close date and some of my other
custom fields which we'll be setting up
are available here as well
but for now let's just go ahead and
create this new deal
and so what I did there was I actually
created three things
I created the deal which is this page
that we're on now I created the Elon
Musk contact person and I created the
SpaceX organization and everything is
all linked so that's the best way to
input a deal to make sure everything is
linked properly you can see here on the
SpaceX organization
Elon is linked here as a person and
we've got the deal here as well now I
just want to pause there for a second
I'm going to come back and I'm going to
talk about how to use the deals page in
a sec but now I just want to revisit
leads quickly and explain how leads fit
in alongside deals in your sales process
so let's head on over to the lead inbox
now as I mentioned earlier this lead
inbox is useful really for prospecting
or if you're doing any kind of cold
Outreach
so maybe you've got a list of people in
your target industry or demographic you
can upload a spreadsheet if you go to
the import menu here and you can import
that list of leads to this lead inbox
you can click on a lead and this is a
bit like a mini deal all my deal custom
fields and I can link it to a contact I
can link it to an organization just like
I can with a deal I can put notes on
here I can store I can log activities
and I can send emails from the lead now
the use case for a lead is
I would create leads or upload that
Prospect list for contacts who I have no
relationship with we're reaching out to
them for the first time and they're
unqualified we don't really know yet if
they're going to be a good fit for the
product or service that we're selling
and so you start them off as leads you
can you know put your notes log your
activities send your emails all from
here
and then when you make contact with them
when you qualify that yep Tim Cook is a
a good lead you can then convert this
into a deal so you click that convert
button and that's going to move the lead
out of this lead inbox and it's going to
put it on this deal pipeline that's why
my first stage here is qualified lead
the other situation where I would use
the lead inbox is if I'm using
pipedrive's lead booster add-on I have
these features that I can use I can put
a live chat or a chat bot interface on
my website for customers to interact
with my sales team I can also create web
forms if I want to put an inquiry form
on my website and there is this
prospecting tool where I can put in my
target demographics and piperrive can
suggest leads that I should reach out to
so if you are using those features if
you've got inquiry forms on your website
that can feed into this lead inbox you
can then qualify the inquiry before you
convert it to a deal now not everyone
uses the lead inbox it really depends on
your sales process for example in my
business business most people come to me
pretty qualified and warm already most
people see my videos they go to my
website there's a bit of a qualification
process on the site before you can then
book a call and so when you do a book I
use zapier actually to add my calendly
bookings as deals in my pipeline so I
don't really have much need for that
lead inbox I'm not doing any kind of
cold Outreach or prospecting so don't
feel like you have to use that feature
but deals generally everyone is going to
create a deal for the sales
opportunities that you are trying to
close right to pick up where I left off
I've created this deal for Elon Musk and
it's linked with Elon and the SpaceX
organization now in this summary tab I
can put some important information about
the deal up here I can put in the value
of the deal that represents what is the
deal worth from a revenue standpoint so
I can either say this is a
ten thousand dollar deal and so by
attaching that value that is going to
update the value of my pipeline up here
if I want to be more specific I can add
products to my deal so the products we
can set up in the products tab over here
and when you have products or Services
set up I can add a product
I can then start typing so let's say I'm
helping Elon with Asana which is another
service that we provide support on uh
maybe this is going to be a 5 000 job
you can set up various um variations of
products if you have different sort of
packages that you offer that can all be
customized in the products uh menu I can
also attach multiple products to a deal
if I need to quote for multiple services
or products that we offer maybe we're
doing some Asana and maybe I'm also
helping with the uh SpaceX brand maybe
that's going to be a maybe let's say
seven seven and a half thousand dollar
job
I can change quantities I can apply
discounts I can put taxes in here I can
put notes on my product I can change my
currency whether this is tax inclusive
or not and then when I'm happy with how
my products are set up I can save that
and that is going to update the value of
my deal I always recommend trying to use
products if it's relevant because not
only does it more accurately break down
the value of the deal but from a
reporting standpoint I can generate a
report a bit like this that shows the
value of the deals that I've won
segmented by product or service so I can
understand what products or services are
driving value and revenue for the
business it's also really useful
especially if I plan to use pipedrive
for quoting or invoicing I'm not going
to go into this in this video today but
using pipedrive's smart docs feature
which I do have a video which I'll link
up here I can create document templates
for quotes or I can use invoicing
Integrations and those products will
become the line items on those quotes or
invoices and that allows me to just do
more of that kind of mundane admin
paperwork right inside pipedrive and I'm
not having to copy and paste information
from one tool to another in the summary
field you can also add labels to a deal
I like using this for a way of saying if
the deal is hot warm or cold basically
whether it's likely to convert or not
some people use this differently and use
labels to denote the type of deal
here we can update the expected close
date that I've shown you before and if I
scroll down to this details section this
is where we can create custom fields or
data fields to capture additional
information specific to my sales process
now when setting up custom fields in
pipedrive it's important to add fields
to the correct object
so in this details panel this is
generally information specific to this
particular deal or sales opportunity or
transaction essentially so if Elon has
approached me I can write a bit of a
summary here about you know needs help
with SpaceX website and brand
I can write a bit of a summary and so if
I then do another deal with Elon in the
future maybe I'm helping him with Tesla
it's going to have a brand new summary
it's going to be a different deal type
so this information is specific to the
deal or this particular sales
opportunity
scrolling down we have custom Fields
related to the contact itself so this is
where I can put in elon's contact
information his his name phone number
title and so on I can put in extra
fields for things like his birthday
spouse that type of thing
and if I create a new deal in the future
you know this these details will change
for that new deal but this information
is all still the same he still has the
same contact details
and then finally you've got custom
fields on the organization that you can
create and so this could be useful for
things like what type of business is it
is there a parent company what industry
do they operate in number of employees
website that type of information
so just keep that in mind when setting
up your custom Fields is make sure
you're putting the field on the correct
object
you can either add new fields in here by
going to customize Fields or the other
place where you can do this is in your
company settings
if we go to data fields here I can see
all the fields related to leads and
Deals leads and Deals share custom
Fields because you start a lead as a
lead and you convert it into a deal so
they share those custom fields
I can put custom Fields like I said on
the person the organization and I can't
even customize fields on products and
even projects that we create as well so
I'm going to create a new field in here
let's go customize fields and add a
custom field
you can start by giving your field a
name for example maybe I want to use a
custom field to show the main point of
contact for this project so I'm going to
say
point of contact
now for field type there are different
types of fields we can create so you've
got normal text or large text Fields you
can create drop down menus either a
single option or multi-option if you
want to be able to select more than one
choice
there's autocomplete numerical monetary
user is quite useful if you want to link
other users in pipedrive for example I
have this sales development rep field if
I want to link who was the SDR that
helped with this deal
I can also link extra organizations I
can put in dates addresses that type of
thing
so for this point of contact I'm
actually going to use the person field
on the right I do have some options I
can specify if I want this to be shown
always visible in that detail summary
I want to I can specify if I want to
input this in that deal pop-up menu that
we saw earlier and also if I'm using
projects I can display it in my project
view as well
if I'm unprofessional I can choose which
pipelines does this field apply to so
maybe it's not really relevant for
mortgage or sponsorships it's only
relevant for this particular sales
pipeline that I'm in right now
and if I'm unprofessional I can also
enforce certain quality roles so I can
say this field has to be filled in from
The Proposal sent stage and later this
means if my team one of my sales people
tries to move the deal to the next stage
and this field has not been filled in
they're going to be asked to fill in
this field they're not going to be able
to progress the deal until that is
filled in
so let's go ahead and save that now
and click done so now I can fill in this
field and because it's a contact field I
can type in the name of a contact
pipedrive is either going to search the
database for a contact or in this case I
can create a new contact and that now I
can go and you know update that contact
which is linked to the deal some of the
other fields that I've got here so you
can see here's an example of a drop down
menu a single option drop down
I can input the sales development rep so
here are my pipedrive users I can
specify which SDR helped me with this
deal I can put in date fields
I can specify times for things like
booking times or appointment times
I can use numerical fields for things
like the client's budget or possibly
even tracking commissions
and a field that I recommend everyone
should have this is super useful
everyone needs this is deal source so
where did the deal come from maybe this
was a referral that's going to be really
useful later on I can do a report where
I can see for the deals that I've won
how many were from referrals versus
Facebook or LinkedIn and I can really
drill down into what marketing is
working well or I can say if a contact
referred this person
so those are my deal details really nice
sort of snapshot there of the key
information about the deal
and again at this stage I would also
recommend customizing some of those
contact and organization Fields as well
so at this point we've Now set up your
pipeline stages and we've customized the
fields on the deal the person and the
organization now I want to share some
best practices in terms of how to use
pipedrive on a daily basis now the big
takeaway here is keep pipedrive up to
date I recommend keeping pipedrive open
in your browser throughout the day so if
you get on a phone call or you are
exchanging emails with a lead you have
pipedrive ready and you can be updating
the CRM so you can put your notes into
the deal you can log your activities or
your interactions and you can schedule
what you need to do next the majority of
the deal page is dedicated to seeing a
timeline of all the history the changes
the notes activities and emails related
to the deal so really think of this as
somewhere you can look to see everything
you might need to know about a potential
deal and a lot of people sort of believe
that yeah we want to put everything on
the deal so if somebody on my team is
away or a salesperson is ill we we can
go to the deal and we've got all the
information in one place
now up the top here we have a few
different tools available firstly we can
type in notes at any time this is useful
for storing notes during a meeting
potentially or a bit of a summary about
what you need to do next important
information related to the deal so I can
attach that note and it goes down into
my history
I can also on the activities tab
schedule activities for what I need to
do next and we have various activity
types so I've got email call Demo call
voicemails and so on
now you can actually customize these
activities to your sales process by
going to the company settings
and then on the company settings tab
here go to activities
and here is where you can set up new
custom activity types for your business
now one main reason to set up a new or
custom activity type is from a reporting
standpoint here's an example if I go to
my insights I've got this report here
that shows any activity completed this
year I've got you can see my timeline
along the bottom and I'm segmenting by
type so I can see how many calls emails
referrals proposal presentations and
things we've done so that's a really
nice sort of useful thing we can do with
pipedrivers see what are we doing what
activities are we doing each month how
much follow-up are we doing I can also
segment this for different people on my
team so I can see which sales people are
doing certain activities so that's one
of the main reasons you want to
customize these activities is if there's
something specific you want to report on
like how many presentations we've done
or quotes we've sent if you want to
report on those kinds of things set
those up custom activities when I create
an activity I can just give it a simple
due date if I just want to say this is
an email follow-up due on the 7th I can
just say it's due all day or if it's a
meeting maybe I've got this meeting at a
specific time I can put in a start and
an end time and you can see it gets
scheduled on the calendar here there are
options to connect your Google or your
Microsoft calendar to pipedrive so if I
schedule this here in pipedrive it will
actually go on to my Google or Outlook
calendar
so I could give this a custom name like
meeting with Elon to scope project
and I'm using the meeting activity type
if I want I could actually invite guests
to this meeting so this is when I click
save and send it's actually going to
send an invite to this person and it's
going to add the meeting as an
appointment on both of our calendars
I can either type in a location or if I
have a zoom Microsoft or Google meet
integration setup I can actually create
a video conference link right here
inside of pipedrive
I can put some notes in here
these are for internal use so this is
just a reminder to myself of like what
we're talking about in the meeting or
during the meeting I might type my notes
in here to log you know what it is we
discussed whereas the description here
this is the public facing description
that Elon in this case would see
and then down the bottom you can assign
the activity to somebody on the team so
this is obviously an activity for me but
I can assign activities to Lindsay or
Warwick other people on my team if they
need to do something for this deal
and because I've created this activity
on the Elon Musk deal the activity is
also being linked with the Elon Musk
contact person and the SpaceX
organization
and so by logging that activity here if
I go to the SpaceX organization I can
see that note and my activity at the
organization level as well because
everything is linked I'm not going to
cover all of these features here but the
other main thing I want to highlight in
this video is the email integration now
I don't have my email connected for this
demo account so if I just switch over to
my main account when I click in here
I've got my Google account connected so
what I can do is I can compose an email
directly here in pipedrive and then when
I hit send it's actually going to send
the email through my Google account in
this case so I can still go to my Gmail
and see that email in my sent items but
I'm just composing it and sending it
from pipedrive
doing it from pipedrive is really nice
because it just keeps a heap a history
of the email on the deal so I can go
back and look at those conversations but
it's also really quick and convenient so
I can have pre-built templates ready to
go I can pick one of my templates which
populates the email the person's name
fills in with these fields and I can
choose if I want to track opens and
clicks uh for the email as well and then
I can hit send then if the recipient
Warwick in this case replies I'm going
to see that reply both here inside the
deal and in my mailbox over here as well
now this email sync feature does require
you to be on at least the advanced
subscription of pipedrive or greater I
usually recommend people get at least
Advanced unless you're on a tight budget
in which case get essential but I
recommend at least Advanced purely for
this feature actually because it's
really convenient being able to send and
receive your emails natively in
pipedrive and if you want to learn more
about using this email feature including
how to automatically trigger emails when
you move the deal to various stages then
check out this video that I've linked up
here with more details about email sync
now one of the most important things
you'll do with your CRM is manage your
follow-up now the best practice with
follow-up is make sure that every single
one of your deals always has an activity
scheduled so you know what you need to
do next even if that's just following up
on a quote you know maybe the ball is in
the other person's court now you've sent
that quote you've sent that proposal but
being a good proactive salesperson you
should have an activity scheduled on
your deals to follow up at an
appropriate time give them a call send
them an email that says hey you know
have you made a decision decision is
there anything else we can do so that's
the first key best practice is make sure
you always have an activity scheduled on
the deal then on a daily basis you can
work from your activities list to see
which follow-ups you need to do that day
I can see all my activities on the
activities tab here
and there are a few different view
options and controls on this page
firstly in the top left I can filter and
look at only certain types of activities
if I want so if I want to only look at
you know emails and you know these
certain activities I can turn on these
filters to be honest I don't really ever
use that personally but the option is
there
on the right hand side I can change the
view so at the moment I'm looking at all
my activities but I can view the
activities for other members of my team
if I want to see what other people are
doing
and then here we can change the time
frame so I can look at everything due
this week or anything that's potentially
overdue as well now this little number
here number eight this represents the
sum of the activities you have due today
and activities that are overdue so you
can see up here I have eight activities
due today which is why this is showing
eight if I had let's say two that were
overdue as well this would actually show
a 10. so your goal each day is get that
number to zero to do that I recommend
working from this screen I quite like
enabling this split view feature so I
can then pick a deal the deal slides
into view but I can still see my
activities in the background I can then
look at the deal make any changes update
the stage change my notes uh I will then
Mark the activity as done to say that
I've done it I've actually got two here
in this case and then when you complete
all the activities on the deal you're
going to notice this pop-up appear
pipeline is basically prompting you and
saying now that you've completed all the
activities you should schedule the next
follow-up so rather than ignoring this
which is what most people do I would
then say right I'm going to follow up in
seven days time and I'll put a little
reminder to myself follow
UPS on quote so just a little reminder
of what I'm following up about so now I
have this scheduled in a week's time and
so in one week I will see that on my
activities list
and so I would continue like that
throughout the day I want to get all
these activities complete and then
schedule new ones as I go
if I don't have time for everything
maybe I just have a busy day and I don't
quite get to everything I would
recommend selecting anything that you
didn't have time for and then changing
the due date to tomorrow so bump them to
tomorrow rather than letting them go
over to you which ends up getting really
messy reschedule them to tomorrow or the
next day that way you never have
anything overdue and you've always got
you're always keeping on top of those
activities
on your deal page you can get a bit of a
sense of whether you're keeping up or
Not by taking by looking at these little
icons so this green icon here shows me
that I have an activity due today
the gray icon tells me that I have an
activity scheduled in the future but not
today
the red one tells me that this has this
deal has an overdue activity on it so
this one was due earlier today
and this yellow warning tells me that I
have nothing scheduled on this deal so
when you look at your deal screen here
you want to see no red or yellow like
these ones that's bad because you're
falling behind or in this case of Johnny
Ive I don't have anything reminding me
about what to do next so this deal May
well get forgotten about as my pipeline
fills up I'm probably going to forget
about that
so try and keep those activities up to
date you don't want any red or yellow on
this screen you only want to see the
green and gray indicators here now as
you progress your deals through these
various sales stages throughout the
process you may need to lose the deal so
at the top here I can mark the deal as
lost that's basically my way of closing
the deal and saying we didn't win it and
it's it's now dead there's nothing more
we can do and up here I can specify a
lost reason now these are all
customizable if I go to my company
settings here
I can Define my own custom lost reasons
so the most common ones are maybe the
client doesn't respond it was a pricing
issue they went with another option a
competitor or it was just a case of bad
timing or maybe they didn't give a
reason my tip for this page is do not
allow for free form entry of lost
reasons I think pipedrive should remove
this feature quite frankly what that
would mean is that people can then type
in anything they want which makes the
reporting a bit well a lot Messier
instead I think it's better to have
people choose one of the options from
this list
and so now I can say right price was too
high elon's budget is only
five thousand dollars so I can put a bit
of an explanation in here as well and I
can lose the deal so it turns red you
can see my lot my uh comment has been
added and the lost time has been
recorded down here I can change that if
I need to usually you don't but if you
need to change that for reporting
purposes you can and now that deal has
vanished from my pipeline it's still in
the system I can search here
for Elon Musk and I can see there's the
Lost Elon Musk deal so it still exists
in pipedrive but by default the pipeline
only shows you deals that are still open
unless I use a filter I can look at all
my lost deals if I need to if Elon ever
comes back to me one day and says he's
raised a bit of money and he has the
budget now I can come up here and I can
reopen the deal and of course ultimately
the goal is to win the deal so I can
click the one button up here I've now
marked the deal as one I get a little
celebration like this the one time is
recorded here again for reporting
purposes so in my insights I can see how
many deals were won each month and
marking deals as one or lost at the
appropriate time is really important
because then it's going to update my
reports so I can see for example here
how many deals I won each month I can
also report on things like my conversion
rate so I can see how many deals
typically get to each stage of the
process if there's a big drop off
occurring at a certain stage I'll be
able to see that
so I hope you have found this video
useful I was gonna go on and talk next
about automation but I'm already over 40
minutes on this video now so I think
it's better that I end it there if you'd
like to learn more about the features
that I've covered in this video and some
of the other features that I didn't like
Automation and Reporting check out the
