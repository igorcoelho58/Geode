Okay, so here we are inside my copy.ai pro account. I'm going to share all the essential features that this AI platform offers and how you can better and more effectively create content in your business using AI assisted content. Okay, so getting started, we can either create a project from scratch or we can choose from these templates freestyle, Instagram captions or a blog post wizard. This is ideal if you're looking to create a long format blog post. Now we can also access more templates over on the left hand side or the far right hand side. If we click on templates, we can access all these different templates before we generate AI content. So for example, if we click on email, we could select any of these email templates depending on the type of email that we want to create and copy.ai is going to create a template that we can customize with our own content with our own details and then use AI to generate that content. And there's also all these other templates here, social media content, website copy, general business and more. So what we're going to do is navigate up to exit. Then if we navigate over to chat, this is a powerful feature inside copy.ai. If you're familiar with chat GPT, this is essentially the chat GPT interface embedded into copy.ai. We can navigate down here and ask anything. For example, I'm going to add what is a CRM software and is it ideal for small businesses? So this is the prompt that I want to add. Now you can also navigate down and click on browse prompts. And if you're new to creating prompts, this is going to help you create a prompt. For example, if we click on content social media and let's say we want to create a step by step guide, you can see the type of prompt that you can use. Create a step by step guide to instruct how to and then the specific topic. Now the more specific you are with your prompt, the more information that AI has to generate your unique content. Again, we can navigate down here and click on product descriptions, craft and irresistible product description that highlights the benefits of and then your product. So you can see these prompt templates are incredibly helpful. What I'm going to do is exit out of this and use the prompt that I added down here and click on enter, give copy.ai a moment to generate your content. And as you can see, I have this content in here. So two large paragraphs and then down here we have these resources. So these resources have been cited. Now with each of the responses that are generated from your prompt, you can navigate down and you can copy and then add that copy into your website blog, for example, or social media channels, or you can navigate over to add to editor. And as you can see, that's going to copy and paste the AI response from the left hand side over into the editor on the right hand side, which we can now customize the way that we like. So if I navigate up here, I'm going to change this to what is a CRM. And then down here, what I can do is I can play around with this content. For example, I can use the formatting options that are up here if I like. And then we can add these headers over here, header one, two, three. And then we have other formatting options down here. So as you can see, copy.ai has an incredibly practical user interface, meaning you can quickly generate AI content on the left hand side and then add that to the editor for you to then format before adding to your different channels to your website, to your email or other platform. Okay, so what we're going to do is navigate back to our dashboard by clicking copy.ai. And then one of the most popular templates is the blog post wizard. This is for those that want to create long format content for their website. If we click here, up above, you can add your blog title or topic. I'm going to add my blog title, which is best AI tools for small businesses and then navigate down to keywords or phrases relevant to your blog. And what you can do is engage in keyword research using copy.ai. And I'll show you how to do this shortly with their chat feature. So I'm going to go ahead and add a few keywords that I've researched earlier on. And again, the more information you add here, these are essentially prompts, then the better the AI generated content. Then come down to tone, choose the type of tone that you're after for your blog post, and then come down and click generate outline. And as you can see, a blog outline has been added, a blog intro will be added here. Then we have the sub headers based on the keywords that we added. And then we have a blog conclusion, which will be added down here. Now, you can also regenerate this content or you can generate more or you can change some of these sub titles for the outline. For example, with this section, I can go ahead and change it if I like or I can click on add to add a new section. And this could be AI video generator. And I can also move this section somewhere else on the page if I like. Okay, so once you're happy with the outline, simply navigate up to generate talking points. And here we have the talking points. Again, what you want to do is take the time to customize each of the different talking points. You can also add additional talking points, generate more content or regenerate these talking points. So go through each of the different sections, the talking points, and make sure the information is correct before you generate the content for each of the different sections and talking points. Simply click on each of the talking points to add your content or to edit the different talking points. Again, you have these options down here for each of the sections and talking points. And when you're happy with your talking points with your sections and you're ready to generate your blog post with AI, simply navigate up to generate content. And as you can see in seconds copy.ai has gone ahead and generated our content for our sections and talking points. What you want to do is take your time to go through each of these sections, the content, go ahead and write more, generate the content, or you can simply go ahead and change the content if you like. However, if you're happy with this content, then you can simply go ahead and click on create blog post. And this is where you can make your final changes before you publish this blog on your website. Again, you have access to these formatting options up above. You want to make sure that you have the right headers. For example, header one, heading two, heading two, heading two, you might have some heading threes that you want to add in, you might want to add some photos, you might want to add some bullet points, and you might want to format the text slightly with bold and italics. You can then navigate over to the far right hand side and you can export and download your new content or you can use AI tools. So for example, if I click on use copy.ai tools, we can now use the chat by copy.ai to generate more content that we then want to add to our editor to our content. Now, we can also navigate over here and make this side larger if we like. So now we have two interfaces. We have our blog content here, and then we also have the chat feature that we can use to generate content. This is essentially chat GPT. All you want to do is add this specific prompts, and then you can add that content into your editor, into your blog post. How good right? As you can see, it's really easy to use, and the whole structure of copy.ai makes this AI tool a very powerful tool for productivity in your business. Again, we can navigate over to chat, so that's going to enable the chat feature. We have templates over here again that we can access, and then if we navigate down, we have other tools. Now tools are mainly templates. For example, if we navigate down to let's say our blog tools and then come down to blog intro, that's going to generate this interface. That's essentially going to help us create specific sections of content. So this is going to help us create a blog intro. If we navigate down to let's say, let's go blog ideas, you can say the interface changes slightly. Again, if we navigate up to, let's say, digital ad copy, let's say Facebook headlines. Again, that's going to generate this interface. It's essentially the same. They've just changed the titles for each of these different sections. If we navigate down to projects, that's going to take us to our projects. Now we can also manage and organize all our projects through folders. If we click on create folder, we can navigate over here and type in for example blog posts and then hit create folder. And then what we can do is for example, come down here and click on move to folder and then click on blog posts and click on move project. And so you can manage all your AI generated content, your projects within copy.ai. Now let's navigate back over to templates before we finish and let's click on email. Let's navigate over to cold outreach email and click on start new project. Again, this is the template interface that is generated. So this interface with the title section and then the body and then also the tone is the same throughout all the different templates and tools. However, because we selected a template, you can see that we have a template in here that we can now customize the way that we like before we generate the content. All you need to do is change this information in these brackets, recipient's name and short description, your name and short description. Then down here we have more like goal of email. What do you want them to do? Add this information and then click generate content. So as you can see, copy.ai is a powerful tool for writing content, generating ideas, brainstorming. You can even summarize websites, YouTube videos, blog posts. And you can also repurpose content through copy.ai. There's so much you can do.
