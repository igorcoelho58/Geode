 meetings is where the magic or chaos
happens ideas fly deals get sealed and
let's be honest a lot gets forgotten
Research indicates that the average
attention span during meetings is
usually 10 to 18 minutes long now I
don't know about you but I don't have
the luxury of 10minute meeting so does
that mean that a lot of the important
stuff gets forgotten well that's where
AI noakers come in these tools help you
transcribe and track conversations so
that you can focus on talking instead of
scribbling down notes hey there I'm Alex
NOS from Automation helpers.com and we
help companies like yours get set up and
automated using industry leading portals
apps and Integrations now plain and
simple every business should have an AI
notetaking tool but not every AI
notetaking tool is created equally in
this video we're going to break down
some of the best AI note taking tools
and compare their differences looking at
their accuracy features pricing and and
Integrations two of these tools I
actually use so let's dive in and take a
look let's kick things off with
fireflies AI a tool that we actually use
internally to automatically transcribe
summarize and analyze our meetings which
makes it easier to track key discussions
and takeaways we've actually built an
automated business operating system that
automatically pulls in notes and action
items from fireflies.ai links it
directly to the correlating project so
that our team doesn't have to spend
hours going through transcripts or
trying to remember that task that that
client wanted them to do if your team
has regular meetings and needs a
reliable way to capture notes action
items and key takeaways well
fireflies.ai is definitely worth
considering it's incredibly accurate and
the free plan is incredibly generous
you'll see that we have a number of ways
to search a meeting transcript as well
we can filter through the focus as well
interestingly the sentiment and we also
have specific speakers which has yet to
fail me we can also quickly search for
keywords to surface relevant meeting
highlights fireflies offers a free plan
that includes unlimited transcription
limited AI summaries and 800 minutes of
storage per seat this plan is generous
and perfect for individuals starting out
for those seeking more advanced features
and greater capacity fireflies AI
provides Pro business and Enterprise
plans each with with varying levels of
storage Integrations and support to
connect your fireflies AI to other apps
and we're not talking about Zoom Google
meets or video conferencing we're
talking about sharing the meeting notes
with another app like slack or air table
well you will need to upgrade to a paid
plan as well as if you want to receive
unlimited storage premium features and
AI search and filtering oh yeah you're
going to have to upgrade next up we have
otter AI one of the most well-known AI
powered node takers Within estimated 20
million users it's widely used by
professionals students and businesses
for realtime transcription and
collaboration Auto AI stands out for its
real-time transcription meaning you can
access your meeting notes while you're
still in the meeting also just like
fireflies it connects with all major
video conferencing platforms like Google
meets zoom and Microsoft teams one of
the best features of uto AI is its
collaborative workspace allowing teams
to highlight comment and edit
transcriptions in real time it's AI
powered summaries break down long
conversations into key takeaways but
this is only available on the paid plan
unlike fireflies so what about the price
tag of those paid plans the free plan
provides you with 300 minutes per month
but that's capped at a limit of only 30
minutes per conversation so really you
only get 10 conversations a month and
you'll need to cut those conversations
short or pull out your pen and paper to
start taking notes M the summarization
of transcripts is also really lacking in
comparison to fireflies that is unless
you are on that paid plan which bumps
you up to 1,200 monthly transcription
minutes with a cap again at 90 minutes
per conversation regardless of those
limits on meeting times OT AI is still a
solid choice and when we consider the
well priced entry level plan well it
could be the right tool for your
business now let's talk about fathom a
rising star in the AI note taking space
it offers fre unlimited recordings for
individuals which is something rare
among AI powered meeting assistants it
also connects with zoom Microsoft teams
and Google meets unlike the other tools
we'll cover fathom offers that free
unlimited recording plan however you
only get five AI summaries per month so
you will be going through the
transcripts of majority of your meetings
it standout feature is the realtime note
taking and timestamped highlights
meaning you can revisit important
moments in a conversation while you're
still in the conversation for teams
fathom offers A Team edition at $19 a
month and a team Edition Pro a bit
higher at $29 a month with more advanced
collaboration tools one fullback of
fathom is in its native Integrations and
ability to connect with other platforms
I want to be able to connect my AI not
taking tool to my other platforms
particularly my project management so I
can directly link a meeting I had with a
client with that client's record next we
have AA and AI powered noeker designed
specifically for sales and customer
facing teams unlike other tools we've
looked at aoma doesn't just transcribe
meetings and summarize those meetings it
also provides deep insights into how to
improve sales conversations aoma offers
AI not taking conversation intelligence
and speaker tracking the conversation
intelligence well this is aimed at
improving your future sales
conversations by looking at what you
might have stuffed up in the past aom
integrates well with CRM tools sales
platforms and of course connects with
the usual video conferencing apps like
zoom and Google meet a key advantage of
aoma is in its conversation intelligence
which helps sales team track patterns
measure engagement and improve client
interactions it also provides real-time
coaching insights making it an excellent
tool for sales and customer focused
teams however no free plan here a 14-day
free trial is offered though if you want
to take a look after that you'll
expecting a $19 a month subscription for
that entry level plan this option is
definitely pricier than the other
competitors but if your team is sales
and customer facing Focus well it could
be the right tool to improve your
overall customer engagement and finally
we have TLD DV too long didn't view a
great AI powered notaker designed
specifically for remote teams and a sync
collaboration unlike some of the other
tools TLD DV or to Long didn't view spe
specifically aims at creating an AI
notaker for us remote teams TV works
with the usual video conferencing
platforms Google meets Zoom Microsoft
teams but what it does slightly
different is it allows users to create
timestamps while in meeting so they can
look back and remember important moments
that they wanted to remind themselves
about it also allows quick note sharing
and summarization but really it doesn't
offer anything more than what fireflies
or any one of the other competitors do
the free plan though packs a punch
allowing users to access essential AI
driven meeting features at no cost you
can enjoy unlimited meetings and viewers
with 10 AI meeting summaries each month
oh one thing that I almost forgot to
mention and I need to is that TLD DV or
too long didn't view actually offers
transcription in over 30 languages so if
your team is diverse well they've got
you covered and the AI summaries and
speaker recognition also works for those
different languages the platform also
offers Integrations with platforms like
slack Gmail and calendar tools and other
features like automatic meeting
recording clipping and embedding and a
meeting view tracker allowing you to
understand what meetings you've got
coming up will help your team work
efficiently and manage their meetings
while the free plan is generous heavier
AI usage and more uploads require an
upgrade to a paid plan each of these AI
not takers Has Its Own Strength well we
took a look at some of the options out
there so which one is going to be best
for you and your team fireflies AI is
definitely one of the best options for
businesses and sales teams who need
Integrations great AI summarization and
a pricing that doesn't hurt the bank
otter AI is also great for General
business use with realtime transcription
and team collaboration but I would point
you in the direction of fireflies over
otter just because you get more bang for
your buck fathom which offers the best
free plan with unlimited recordings and
some AI meeting summaries is great for
individuals or small teams wanting to
dip their toes into AI note taking aoma
is great for sales teams needing AI
powered insights and more functional CRM
Integrations and to Long didn't view is
a great option for remote teams but
again I would still point you in the
direction of fireflies as we can see
when we stack each tool side by side
fireflies and fathoms free plans are
great to Long didn't view is another
awesome option however if you want the
premium features well Auto AI entry
level plan is enticing but we've got to
remember the per meeting limits which
can quickly become a nuisance if you're
looking for a truly hands-off experience
with fewer limits then upgrading to the
business plan might be necessary and in
that case fireflies or faom are a
cheaper option well I hope this video
has been helpful and I'm curious to
