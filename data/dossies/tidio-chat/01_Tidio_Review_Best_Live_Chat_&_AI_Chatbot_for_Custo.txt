Integrate e-commerce features like product recommendations and order tracking. So Tidio is built to serve a small and medium-sized businesses that need quick, effective customer communication tools without enterprise level complexity. Getting started with Tidio. So you can click the link down below in the description to go ahead and get started with Tidio. You can create an account using either your email or you can connect through a Google account. During onboarding, Tidio asks about your business type, e-commerce, services, etc. And suggests a recommended setup. You can usually start with a free plan which includes basic live chat and limited chat bot usage. Installing the chat widget. So after signing up, Tidio guides you through installing the chat widget on your website. If you use WordPress or Shopify, you can install the Tidio plugin or app. Then follow the prompts to connect your account. For custom websites, copy and paste a short JavaScript snippet into your site's header. The widget will appear instantly ready for visitors to start chatting. Starting up a chat bot flow. Tidio's chat bot builder is visual and intuitive. Here's how to create a simple welcome bot. Choose a template or start from scratch. Tidio offers pre-built templates like welcome message, lead generation, or FAQ bot. Select one or build your own. Define a trigger. For a welcome bot, the trigger could be visitor lands on any page. Add actions. An action might be sending a greeting like, hi there. How can we help you today? Or offering a quick menu with options. Like tracking order, product info, talk to an agent, use conditions. If a visitor selects track and order, the bot can ask for an order number. If they choose talk to an agent, the conversation can be transferred to a human agent. Drag and drop blocks to build your flow. Preview it in real time to ensure it responds as expected. Enabling Lyro AI. Lyro is Tidio's AI powered chat bot. Unlike rule-based flows, it uses natural language understanding. To set it up, upload knowledge base. Provide documents like FAQs, product manuals, or curated lists of questions and answers. Lyro learns from this data and improves over time. Define confidence thresholds. Besides how confident Lyro must be to answer a question. Confidence is low. Lyro can transfer the conversation to a human agent. Test and train. Ask common questions and evaluate Lyro's responses. Add clearifications or adjust to knowledge base if needed. Managing conversations. All chats, whether from live agents, bots, or social channels, appear in a unified inbox. Agents can see visitor details like location, page thereon, order history, and respond directly. You can use canned responses to answer common queries quickly. If multiple agents are available, assign conversations based on expertise or availability. Pricing tiers. Let's go ahead and take a look at Tidio's different pricing plans. So if you've got a click link down below in the description, as you can see, you can go ahead and get started here for free. But let's go ahead and click on pricing. So they have several different plans here. They've got a starter plan, a growth plan, a plus plan, and a premium plan that you need to contact for pricing. Now, these all are going to change based on how many conversations you need per month. So these are the starting prices at 100 conversations per month. But maybe you have a huge website and you need more than that. So maybe you need about 10 times that at a thousand conversations per month. I think you can see the starter plan price stayed the same, but the growth increased up to $149.17 from $49.17. So about a hundred bucks. Now if you need more than that, maybe twice as much as that at 2000. You can see that again, the growth plan changes. Now, the reason that the starter plan doesn't change is you only get 100 billable conversations. So you're kind of maxed out there. So this really applies to the growth plan here. So if you need anything over 2000 conversations per month, then you're going to need the plus plan. So with the starter plan, you get 100 billable conversations, basic analytics, live visitors list, and operating hours. With the growth plan, you get everything in the starter plan plus 2000 billable conversations, depending on how many conversations you choose here, advanced analytics, tideo power features, no tideo branding, and permissions. On the plus plan, you get everything in the growth plan plus a custom quota of billable conversations, a dedicated success manager, custom branding, multi-project, departments, multi-language, open API, and support over live chat. Now, if we scroll down a little bit further, we can go ahead to step two here, and this way, you can go ahead and add things like the Lerio AI agent and flows. So again, here you go ahead and select how many you need per month, maybe you need 200 per month. That's going to be an extra $116 for the Lyro AI agent. And with the flow, same thing here. If you go to maybe 2000 visitors reach per month, that's going to be an additional $24 per month for a total of $431 per month, with all of these settings here. Pros and cons of tideo, advantages, ease of use. The interface is super clean and beginner friendly. Setting up a basic chatbot takes just minutes, and the live chat widget looks modern. Multi-channel support. You can manage website chats, social media messages, and emails all from one place. This unified approach saves time and prevents missing messages, native integrations. Tidio plugs directly into e-commerce platforms and CRMs, making it super easy to sync product catalogs or customer data. Quick onboarding. You don't need technical knowledge to install and configure the widget. Tidio provides clear steps and helpful templates. Good customer support. Reviews highlight responsive support via chat and email. There are tutorials and a knowledge base for troubleshooting. Drawbacks. Limited analytics. Although Tidio provides basic metrics, it lacks deep insights in reporting. If you need granular data like chat funnel analysis, you might need a third party tool. AI customization constraints. Lyro's knowledge training is straightforward, but you can't combine Lyro with complex flow-based bots. You must choose between rule-based flows or the AI assistant for each chat widget. Marketing limitations. Tidio focuses on support rather than marketing. Unlike some other platforms, it doesn't include advanced features like email campaigns or SMS marketing. Cost at scale. The pricing for Lyro's based on conversations. Your website receives a high volume of queries. Cost can rise quickly. So evaluate whether the AI answers justify the expense. Understanding these pros and cons helps set expectations and will help guide your decision. Comparing reviews and user feedback. Reviewers really generally praise Tidio for its ease of use and multi-channel capabilities. The drag and drop builder allows small businesses to create functional bots without any coding. Users appreciate the ability to integrate with platforms like Shopify and the quick setup. Others note that while the platform is affordable for small teams, cost increase dramatically if you use Lyro at a high volume. For companies with complex automation or marketing needs, it may serve as a starting point rather than a comprehensive solution. Tips for getting the most out of Tidio. Start simple. Begin with a basic welcome flow and gradually add complexity. This prevents overwhelming visitors with too many options. Use proactive messaging. Trigger chat invitations based on behavior like a visitor spending time on a pricing page to increase engagement. Train your AI. If you enable Lyro, update the knowledge base regularly with new FAQs. The more relevant data you provide, the better it performs. Monitor performance. Even though analytics are basic, pay attention to metrics such as response time and customer satisfaction ratings. Quick responses keep visitors engaged. Integrate with your store. If you're an e-commerce site, use Tidio's product recommendation feature. You can display relevant products during chats to drive sales. Provide human backup. Bots are great for repetitive questions, but always offer an easy path to a human agent. This improves user experience when issues require empathy or nuance understanding. Is Tidio the best live chat and AI chat bot tool for customer support? It depends on your business size and needs.
