Frequently Asked Questions
What is a Conversation?
Conversation is any live chat, ticket, email or social media channel conversation. A visitor, operator or an automated flow may initiate a conversation.
Remember that not all conversations are counted as “Billable conversations”
What is a “Billable conversation”?
"Billable conversation" refers to any live chat, ticket, email or social media channel conversation that includes a message from a human agent (you). Unanswered messages initiated by visitors/customers are not counted, ensuring you're billed only for relevant interactions.
Responses from Flows and Lyro AI Agent are not counted as ‘agent replies’.
Will I pay for unwanted conversations?
No. A conversation is only billed as a Billable conversation once you reply using Tidio or proactively initiate a conversation with your visitor. If you don’t respond to a customer conversation – if it’s spam or simply a message that doesn’t require a reply – the conversation won’t count toward your monthly limit.
Will I pay for multiple messages within one conversation?
A conversation that receives a response by a human agent or is initiated by a human agent will only be counted as one Billable conversation regardless of how many messages are sent or received on the thread.
How does the free trial work?
During the free 7-day trial, you can test all Tidio features and plans and see how to improve customer service and accelerate sales. You don’t need to provide us with your credit card information to access the free trial.
At the end of the trial, your account will automatically be downgraded to the Free plan unless you upgrade your subscription to a paid option.
It means that you can use the full feature set of any Customer Service, Lyro AI Agent or Flows plan within your first 7 days with Tidio.
Can I change my subscription anytime I want?
Yes, you can. You can downgrade or upgrade your subscription at any time.
Please note that any subscription changes will come into effect at the start of your next billing cycle meaning that you will keep your premium features until the end of the existing cycle.
Can I add Tidio live chat to more than one website/store?
Yes, you can add Tidio to multiple sites and/or stores.
Please note, however, that the live chat widget will share all the appearance and behavior settings across all your websites/stores. This means it will have the same color scheme, it will go online/offline according to the same DND hours, it will display the same offline messages, etc. If you want to have a different behavior for every website, talk to us.
Can I send live chat messages?
Yes. The Customer Service plans enable you to proactively engage your website visitors through the live chat widget.
What is Lyro AI Agent?
Lyro is an AI agent that solves up to 67% of customer questions automatically. It turns customer questions into conversations and delivers personalized replies like a human agent.
Unlike Flows which follow set rules and pathways to generate an answer, Lyro relies on machine learning to understand customer questions and draws information from your support content to create detailed responses.
What is a Lyro conversation?
A Lyro conversation is a customer interaction initiated through any channel integrated with Tidio that has at least one reply from our AI Agent.
Even if Lyro replies a dozen times or more to solve the customer’s problem, or if the customer leaves the chat window and returns to it at a later time, that still counts as a single conversation.
Can I purchase Lyro AI Agent or Flows as a standalone product?
Yes, each of our three core products - Lyro AI Agent, Customer Service and Flows - can be purchased individually or as part of a bundled plan in any configuration. This means you can choose to buy only the Lyro AI product or Flows and still benefit from the free limit of human conversations included in all subscriptions.
How can I use Flows?
With any Customer Service plan, you can add Flows templates to your website or manually create as many automated workflows as you want with our drag-and-drop Flows builder.
Although your Flows can have an unlimited number of chats, the Free Customer Service plan limits them to interact with only 100 unique visitors per month. However, you can interact with up to 100 000 visitors per month by purchasing extra quota and a custom number of visitors with the Plus plan.
What’s the difference between Flows and Lyro AI Agent?
Flows
Can be used as a marketing automation tool that converts visitors into paying customers or boosts their order value
Perfect for answering simple, pre-defined questions.
Require manual configuration
Are triggered by specific actions and can proactively engage users
Follow user-defined rules and scripts to answer customer questions
Available only on Tidio
Lyro AI Agent
AI-powered support chatbot that helps you solve up to 67% of customer problems
Perfect for answering complex customer questions and automating repetitive tasks
Learns from your support content and then uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to understand questions and provide the appropriate answer.
Understands the intent behind customer questions and uses solely your support content to generate personalized responses.
Is not restricted to pre-defined questions. Lyro can answer complex questions in a human-like manner based on the information you feed it.
Available on Tidio. Can also be integrated with other customer service tools
Flows rely on pre-designed conversational paths while Lyro AI Agent uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to understand questions and have human-like conversations with customers. Lyro provides more details to make sure customers are satisfied with the information they receive. On the other hand, Flows can be designed to convert visitors into buyers.
Keep in mind that you don’t have to choose between Lyro AI Agent and Flows. You can use both solutions at the same time to provide exceptional service to your customers.
When will my Lyro conversation limit refresh?
Every Tidio account starts with 50 Lyro conversations, but you need to upgrade to the Lyro AI Agent plan to refresh it monthly.
You can access higher Lyro conversation limits with the Lyro AI Agent and Plus plans. If you’re using the Lyro AI Agent or Plus plans, your limit refreshes 30 days from the moment you make the payment.
When will my Flows limit refresh?
The limit refreshes every 30 days. If you are on the paid plan, the limit will refresh after 30 days, starting from the moment you have made your payment.
If you are on the Free plan, the limit will refresh after 30 days, starting from the moment you have created your account or from the moment when your last paid subscription has finished.
How does the ticketing system work?
Tidio’s AI-powered ticketing system enables you to transform incoming support emails, live chat conversations, and social media messages into tickets and assign them to available operators.
You can monitor tickets and add notes or custom tags to follow up on conversations.
Tidio automatically analyzes your conversations and organizes them based on customer intent so your support team can easily spot and prioritize important requests.
How many support agents can I add to my Tidio project?
You can add up to 10 agents on self-serve plans and custom numbers on the Plus package.
