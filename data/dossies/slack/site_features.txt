Why should my company use Slack?
Excellent question. Slack is a new way for your entire company to work. Instead of email, Slack is a faster, better-organized, and more secure platform — all your communication is organized into channels that are easy to create, join, and search. When there’s a channel for everything going on at your company, everyone knows exactly where to go to get work done. Slack also brings AI into the flow of work, helping you throughout your workday, making it faster and easier to find and act on the information you need. And unlike email, Slack integrates with all the other systems in your tech stack to become the single OS for all your work. Slack puts everything and everyone you need to get work done in one single place, so no more context switching, data silos, or lost intel.

How do channels in Slack drive productivity?
Work in Slack starts with channels. By creating a channel for all your projects, teams, offices, and departments — everything you’re doing at work — you create a space for every conversation to happen. And because channels are easy to join and create, Slack can adapt to meet changing needs. If someone new joins a project, simply add them to the channel and they can scroll up to read through old conversations. When it’s time to start something new, create a new channel and invite the right people.

How does Slack AI protect the security of your data?
Slack AI runs on Slack’s trusted infrastructure, and upholds the security practices and compliance standards that customers expect from Slack itself. Slack does not share customer data with LLM (large language model) providers and does not use customer data to train LLMs.
Our LLMs are hosted directly within Slack’s AWS virtual private cloud, ensuring that your data remains in-house. Learn more

Is Slack secure?
Yes — you can securely discuss confidential information in Slack. Slack offers multiple ways to ensure that your information, conversations, and files stay safe. Slack delivers enterprise-grade security at every layer, adhering to multiple compliance certifications, including SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO/IEC 27001, and more. Slack is GDPR-compliant and can be configured for HIPAA and FINRA compliance. It is FedRAMP Moderate authorized.
In addition, Slack offers advanced security features, like Enterprise Key Management, that allow admins fine-grained control over data encryption. You can also integrate your own security tools with Slack to get an instant notification if a threat is detected. Learn more about Slack’s comprehensive security program

Is Slack more secure than e-mail?
Yes! Unlike email, Slack is not susceptible to spam or phishing, which causes 90% of data breaches. Your Slack handle cannot be sold to advertisers or put on a mailing list, and you will only ever receive Slack messages from other people inside your organization, or from trusted partners using
Slack Connect
. You may get notifications from apps integrated with your workspace, such as Asana, Google Docs, or Jira.
Slack offers enterprise-grade data protection and privacy. Granular controls allow admins to customize security for each user, so no one sees anything they shouldn’t. Learn more about how
Slack can securely replace email
inside your company.
What is Slack Connect?
Slack Connect is a more secure and productive way for organizations to communicate together. It lets you move all the conversations with your external partners, clients, vendors, and others into Slack, replacing email and fostering collaboration. Slack’s enterprise-grade security features and compliance standards, like Enterprise Key Management, extend to Slack Connect. Learn more about Slack Connect
