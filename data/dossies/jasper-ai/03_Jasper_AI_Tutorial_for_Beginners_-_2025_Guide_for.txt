Now, let's go through a few practical use cases and see how you can use this tool as a powerful marketing foundation for your campaign. Let's start with something simple. We'll head over to featured categories and select social media marketing. Here, you'll see all the different apps available under this category. Jasper gives you the ability to write posts and create content specifically for various social media platforms. For today's example, we're going to focus on writing a Facebook post and I'll show you how using Jasper's powerful AI you can create a high-quality post in just a few minutes. We can customize the post by using our own brand voice, selecting the language for the post, and even uploading up to five source materials, such as a file, a URL, text, or some saved knowledge. Once you've uploaded your materials, just press next, and you'll move on to the key message section. Here's where you define the main goal of your post and what key message you want to communicate to your audience. Now I'm going to type in the text for our Facebook post, introducing the new smart lamp, control your home lighting with just a tap on your smartphone, stylish, easy to use, and energy efficient. This is going to be the base for our Facebook promo post. Let's press next. In the box for additional content, you can add a prompt if you want. For example, mention free shipping for the first 100 customers. I'll add that here as well. Next, we need to select the preferred post length. You can choose short, medium, or long. For Facebook, it's usually better to keep post concise, so I'll choose short. You can also customize further by adding target audience details. Your brand voice, custom information, and even generate an image to go along with the post. Jasper will create a written post and suggest an image. You can either let Jasper generate the image based on your text or add your own custom prompt. For now, I'll trust Jasper's suggestion and use its generated post to create the image. I'm not going to add more context, so let's go ahead and generate the post. Now, the process has started. First Jasper is creating the image and writing the post. Let's wait just a few minutes. All right, the image looks great. It's high quality, but I did notice there are some spelling mistakes in the text inside the image. The words customer and lamp are spelled incorrectly. My recommendation. Remove the text from the image and keep all the promotional text only in the Facebook post itself. This way the image looks clean and professional. Now, I'll regenerate the image without any text. And here it is. The post Jasper created was a bit too short. Only about 80 characters. So I'll go back and adjust the settings to make it slightly longer. Jasper automatically added more content to the post. And honestly, I really like how it turned out. It sounds great. You can rate the content Jasper produces and I'm giving this one a like because it's really good. There's also a full editor here where you can highlight text, make it bold, italic, create bullet lists, number lists, add links, and more. It's a complete post editor. Plus, if you want to tweak or remix the post, you can chat with Jasper directly and ask it to make changes or improvements. Or you can explore other favorite models of the app for even more functionality. All right, let's move on to the next use case. This time we are going to create a new email campaign. However, keep in mind that this feature is only available in the business plan. So your team will need to get a message and approve the upgrade to access it. Now for the next example, let's create an SEO optimized blog post. First, we can select the voice in language for the post generation. Let's move on to the topic. I'm choosing top digital marketing trends in 2025. Next, we'll choose a target audience and Jasper offers some helpful suggestions you can pick from. After that, it asks for the outline of your post. Here, you can type in a short plan or structure you want Jasper to follow. I'll quickly write a few main blogs I want to include. This will help guide the AI and ensure the article sounds more professional and well organized. In the custom information section, you can add keywords for SEO purposes. And in the next part, you can add even more context if needed. Just like before, I'll also ask Jasper to generate an image to go along with the article. Now let's start the generation process. And as you can see, Jasper completely followed the outline we provided. The article includes titles, subtitles, bullet points, and lists. Everything you'd want for a ready to publish SEO optimized blog posts. You can either publish it right away, remix it, or chat with Jasper to make any final tweaks. Now let's move on to another tool. The Content Rewriter. Here, you can upload the original text you want to rewrite up to 10,000 characters. I'm going to upload my technical article, which I want to polish and finalize. You can either type your own instructions or choose one of the preset options, like change the tone, make it shorter and more concise, summarize and highlight key points. For this tutorial, I'll choose summarize and highlight key points. Now let's watch Jasper work. It's analyzing the text and rewriting it based on the instructions we provided. Super fast and super accurate. Also, Jasper can help you with images. For example, you can easily remove the background from a picture you upload. Let's test it, so now I'll upload the image of the smart lamp we used earlier. And as you can see, Jasper completely removed the background, clean and precise. From here, you can either continue editing with Jasper's built-in editor or simply download the image and use it in any external design tool. As you can see, Jasper is truly a universal marketing tool. And believe it or not, I've shown you less than 1% of what Jasper can actually do.
