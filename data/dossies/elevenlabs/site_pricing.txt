Frequently asked questions
What is usage-based billing?
Usage-based billing allows you to continue generating content after you reach your monthly credit quota. When enabled, you will be charged a fixed price for every additional 1,000 credits used beyond your plan’s included limit.
How do text characters and credits work?
Each text character you generate consumes credits, with the exact cost depending on the model used.
For V1 English, V1 Multilingual, and V2 Multilingual models, 1 text character equals 1 credit.
For V2 Flash/Turbo English and V2.5 Flash/Turbo Multilingual models, discounted pricing applies, costing between 0.5 and 1 credit per character depending on your subscription plan.
When do my credits reset, and do unused credits roll over?
Your credit allowance resets at the start of each billing cycle, which begins on the day you subscribed.
Unused credits can roll over for up to two months as long as you maintain an active paid subscription and do not downgrade or cancel. When your subscription renews, you will receive a new monthly allotment of credits.
Is there a limit on how many credits I can use in a single request?
Yes. There is a maximum number of credits that can be used in a single generation request. The limit depends on whether you are on the Free tier or a paid subscription.
Am I charged for every generation?
Credits are charged per generation request, not per download. If you are not satisfied with the output, a limited number of free regenerations may be available as long as the content and certain settings do not change. Whether a regeneration is free is indicated before generating.
What happens if I upgrade, downgrade, or cancel my subscription?
If you upgrade to a higher plan, any unused credits from your previous plan will roll over into the next billing cycle.
If you downgrade or cancel your subscription, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. After that, your account will be downgraded to the Free plan and any unused paid credits will expire.
When can I cancel my subscription?
You can cancel your subscription at any time. Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle, after which it will not renew and your account will be downgraded to the Free plan.
How do I check how many credits I have remaining?
You can view your remaining credits by logging into the platform and navigating to your subscription page from your profile menu.
What kind of payment do you accept?
We accept Credit Card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Subscriptions are billed on a monthly or yearly basis starting from the day you subscribe.
