Hi there, welcome to part 7 of a 10-part series on everything that you need to know about Zendesk for service. I'm Devon Henning with Selectube and I am here to give you a detailed tour in my honest, unbiased opinions about Zendesk for service. Its platform, its pricing, its alternatives, and more. In this episode, we're talking about Zendesk for service alternatives. Let's go. Googleing Zendesk alternatives will lead you down a rabbit hole of customer service solutions.

While Zendesk alternatives include a lot of those logos, the most common and most likely competitive would be Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Freshworks. In reviewing why organizations choose Zendesk alternatives, some reasons are the following. 1. Single vendor relationship Certain Zendesk alternatives try to be everything for everyone. They offer multiple solutions for different departments, promoting a 360 degree customer view on a single platform. However, Zendesk for service's strength is that it's a best of breed solution dedicated specifically to customer service. It integrates with other technologies, so organizations can create their own ideal tech stacks without making tradeoffs between CX technology and a single vendor. 2. Low costs and or steep discounts Smaller and or newer Zendesk for service alternatives sometimes offer lower prices that align with their limited functionality. Conversely, established competitors may offer heavy discounts, bundles, or free licenses that look good on paper, but include additional fees for implementation, administrative support, etc. 3. Non-CX specialties Some Zendesk for service alternatives are tailored to non-CX specialties. This makes these options better equipped for non-CX requirements, such as IT, IEL certification, native incident management, and native asset management. However, Zendesk offers apps, integrations, and APIs to accommodate specific non-CX use cases.

Grounded in CX Zendesk originated as a CX solution and is a proven leader there.

User Experience and Ease of Use Zendesk for service was designed to be simple and intuitive so agents and admins can focus on supporting customers, not working with developers.
